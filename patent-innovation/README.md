# Patent Innovation Clusters

> 🎮 Future "Gameboy Cartridge Story" - Patent Innovation Analysis

This repository contains tools and scripts for analyzing temporal clustering
patterns in USPTO patent data across different technology categories.

## Status

⚠️ **Work in Progress** - This repo is being prepared for future patent
innovation analysis.

## Planned Analysis

This project will analyze:

- USPTO patent filing patterns
- Technology category clustering (semiconductors, telecommunications, computing,
  etc.)
- Breakthrough innovation detection (citation-based)
- Simultaneous discovery patterns across technologies
- Innovation "boom and bust" cycles

## What's Here

### Data Collection

- `src/data_collection/patent_collector.py` - USPTO PatentsView API collector

### Exploration

- `src/exploration/explore_clustering.py` - Interactive clustering exploration
  tools

## Future Plans

This analysis will complement the
[Pharmaceutical Innovation Clusters](../pharmaceutical-innovation-clusters)
project by examining patent-based innovation patterns in technology sectors.

## Data Sources

- **USPTO PatentsView API**: Patent filing and citation data
- Focus on breakthrough patents (top 10% by citations)
- Technology categories: Semiconductors, Telecommunications, Computing,
  Pharmaceuticals

## Usage

🚧 Coming soon - this repo is being set up for future development.

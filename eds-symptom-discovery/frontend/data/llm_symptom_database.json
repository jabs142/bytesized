          "abstract": "Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) affects multiple systems, but comprehensive evaluations of a larger sample of hEDS patients are lacking. The objective of this study was to describe cerebrovascular, autonomic, and neuropathic features of hEDS. This retrospective case-control study was conducted at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital between 2016-2023. Data from hEDS patients who completed autonomic testing and skin biopsies were analyzed. Outcome measures include validated surveys (Survey of Autonomic Functions, Neuropathy Total Symptom Score-6 (SAS)) and autonomic function testing (Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, head-up tilt and sudomotor), cerebrovascular (cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the middle cerebral artery), respiratory (capnography), and neuropathic (skin biopsies for assessment of small fiber neuropathy) testing and inflammatory/ autoimmune markers. Total 270 hEDS patients were analyzed and compared to 29 healthy controls. Common hEDS complaints (prevalence > 90% ) were orthostatic sudomotor, vasomotor, gastrointestinal, and pain. Orthostatic cerebral blood flow velocity was reduced in 79% of hEDS and correlated with orthostatic dizziness. The head-up tilt test revealed postural tachycardia syndrome (prevalence 33%), hypocapnic cerebral hypoperfusion (22%), orthostatic cerebral hypoperfusion syndrome (18%), and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (9%). Widespread but mild autonomic failure was present in 90% of hEDS patients on autonomic testing. Small fiber neuropathy using structural criteria was detected in 64%, and using combined structural and functional criteria in 82%. This study provided evidence of cerebrovascular dysregulation with reduced orthostatic cerebral blood flow velocity associated with symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, frequent small fiber neuropathy, and widespread but mild autonomic failure in hEDS.",

          "abstract": "Despite myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) affecting millions of people worldwide, many clinicians lack the knowledge to appropriately diagnose or manage ME/CFS. Unfortunately, clinical guidance has been scarce, obsolete, or potentially harmful. Consequently, up to 91% of patients in the United States remain undiagnosed, and those diagnosed often receive inappropriate treatment. These problems are of increasing importance because after acute COVID-19, a significant percentage of people remain ill for many months with an illness similar to ME/CFS. In 2015, the US National Academy of Medicine published new evidence-based clinical diagnostic criteria that have been adopted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, the United States and other governments as well as major health care organizations have recently withdrawn graded exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy as the treatment of choice for patients with ME/CFS. Recently, 21 clinicians specializing in ME/CFS convened to discuss best clinical practices for adults affected by ME/CFS. This article summarizes their top recommendations for generalist and specialist health care providers based on recent scientific progress and decades of clinical experience. There are many steps that clinicians can take to improve the health, function, and quality of life of those with ME/CFS, including those in whom ME/CFS develops after COVID-19. Patients with a lingering illness that follows acute COVID-19 who do not fully meet criteria for ME/CFS may also benefit from these approaches.",

Fatigue and other systemic symptoms that affect daily functioning may occur, as well. Accurate data on incidence and prevalence of HSDs is hampered by lack of awareness of these conditions and the wide heterogeneity of their clinical presentation. Identifying which type of HSD is present is important in guiding appropriate care. In particular, making the diagnosis of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is important, as individuals with hEDS may be at risk for more significant multisystem involvement. Diagnostic criteria for hEDS include measures of joint hypermobility, skin and other connective tissue findings, and lack of evidence of a different type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Beyond accurate diagnosis, HSDs pose many challenges for primary care providers, as ongoing patient education, patient empowerment, and coordination of a multidisciplinary treatment team are integral to proper care. This article describes the incidence and prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of HSDs, including clinical cases exemplifying how joint hypermobility might present within a primary care setting.",

          "abstract": "Patellofemoral instability is a common cause of knee pain and dysfunction in paediatric and adolescent patients. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the frequency of patellar dislocations seen in emergency departments (EDs) and the rates of surgical procedures for patellar instability at paediatric hospitals in the United States between 2004 and 2014. The Pediatric Health Information System database was queried for all paediatric patients who underwent surgery for patellar instability or were seen in the ED for acute patellar dislocation between 2004 and 2014. This was compared with the annual numbers of overall orthopaedic surgical procedures. Between 2004 and 2014, there were 3481 patellar instability procedures and 447 285 overall orthopaedic surgical procedures performed at the included institutions, suggesting a rate of 7.8 per 1000 orthopaedic surgeries. An additional 5244 patellar dislocations treated in EDs were identified. Between 2004 and 2014, the number of patellar instability procedures increased 2.1-fold (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4 to 3.0), while orthopaedic surgical procedures increased 1.7-fold (95% CI 1.3 to 2.0), suggesting a 1.2-fold relative increase in patellar instability procedures, compared with total paediatric orthopaedic surgeries. This study shows a significant rise in the rate of acute patellar instability treatment events in paediatric and adolescent patients across the country. Surgery for patellar instability also increased over the study period, though only slightly more than the rate of all paediatric orthopaedic surgical procedures. This may suggest that increasing youth sports participation may be leading to a spectrum of increasing injuries and associated surgeries in children. IV.",

A series of 65 patients were examined prospectively-26 with hEDS, and 39 subjects with chronic neck, knee, or back pain without hEDS. The deep fascia of the sternocleidomastoid, iliotibial tract, and iliac fascia were examined with B-mode ultrasound and strain elastography, and the thicknesses were measured. Stiffness (strain index) was measured semi-quantitatively using elastography comparing fascia to muscle. Differences between groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. hEDS subjects had a higher mean thickness in the deep fascia of the sternocleidomastoid compared with non-hEDS subjects. There was no significant difference in thickness of the iliac fascia and iliotibial tract between groups. Non-hEDS subjects with pain had a higher strain index (more softening of the fascia with relative stiffening of the muscle) compared with hEDS subjects and non-hEDS subjects without back or knee pain. In myofascial pain, softening of the fascia may occur from increase in extracellular matrix content and relative increase in stiffness of the muscle; this change is not as pronounced in hEDS.",

          "abstract": "Children with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) have reduced knee joint proprioceptive acuity compared to peers. Altered proprioception at end of range in individuals with JHS is hypothesised to contribute to recurrent joint injuries and instability. This study aims to provide the first objective comparison of functional knee joint proprioceptive acuity in hyperextension range compared to early flexion range in children with JHS. Active, weight-bearing knee joint proprioceptive acuity in both hyperextension and early flexion range was tested with a purpose-built device. Proprioceptive acuity was measured using the psychophysical method of constant stimuli to determine ability to discriminate between the extents of paired active movements made to physical stops. The smallest difference in knee range of motion that the child is able to correctly judge on at least 75% of occasions, the Just Noticeable Difference (JND), was calculated using Probit analysis. Knee pain, muscle strength, amount of physical activity and patient demographic data were collected. Twenty children aged 8-16 years with JHS and hypermobile knees participated. Eleven children demonstrated better proprioceptive acuity in flexion, and 9 in hyperextension (z = 0.45, p = 0.63). Matched pairs t-test found no significant difference in children's ability to discriminate between the same extents of movement in the hyperextension or flexion directions (mean JND difference 0.11°, 95% CI -0.26° - 0.47°, p = 0.545). However, 3 children could not discriminate movements in hyperextension better than chance. Proprioceptive acuity scores were positively correlated between the two directions of movement (r = 0.55, p = 0.02), with no significant correlations found between proprioceptive acuity and age, degree of hypermobility, muscle strength, pain level, amount of physical activity or body mass index centile (r = -0.35 to -0.03, all p ≥ 0.13). For a group of children with JHS involving hypermobile knees, there was no significant difference between knee joint proprioceptive acuity in early flexion and in hypermobile range when measured by a functional, active, weight-bearing test. Therefore, when implementing a proprioceptive training programme, clinicians should focus training throughout knee range, including into hyperextension. Further research is needed to determine factors contributing to pain and instability in hypermobile range.",

          "abstract": "Chronic widespread pain is a common complaint among individuals affected by generalised joint hypermobility. In the absence of other conditions that cause chronic pain, these individuals are usually diagnosed with joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS). JHS is a multifactorial trait with a strong genetic basis, but no specific genetic markers. Clinical overlap of JHS is seen with heritable connective tissue disorders, particularly with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobile type (hEDS). The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of rare monogenic conditions that are characterised by joint hypermobility, skin and vascular fragility and generalised connective tissue friability, and are caused by genetic defects in an array of extracellular matrix genes. The genetic basis of hEDS remains however unknown, in contrast to other well-described EDS subtypes. In view of the considerable clinical overlap with JHS, many consider it and hEDS to be a single clinical entity. Clinical experience and a limited number of clinical studies show that chronic pain also is common in EDS patients, especially in hEDS. The specific underlying causes and mechanisms of pain in JHS and EDS remain poorly understood. Factors likely contributing to the generation and chronicity of pain include nociceptive pain, directly based on structural changes in affected joints, muscle and connective tissue; neuropathic pain; impaired proprioception and muscle weakness; and central sensitisation. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and likely more than one mechanism may be present. Furthermore, anxiety, depression, and other variables may influence the phenotype. Chronic pain in JHS and EDS patients often is inadequately controlled by traditional analgesics and physical therapy. In view of the high prevalence of these underrecognised conditions, future studies addressing the nature and mediators of chronic pain are needed in order to potentially identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention and optimise treatment.",

The 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes replaced previous terms for symptomatic joint hypermobility with hypermobile EDS and introduced the term hypermobility spectrum disorders for patients not meeting diagnostic criteria for hypermobile EDS. Both are diagnosed by applying the 2017 diagnostic criteria, which also excludes other less common conditions presenting with joint hypermobility such as other forms of EDS and heritable connective tissue disorders. Hypermobile EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but it does not have a known genetic mutation to help with diagnosis. Clinical features of hypermobile EDS include joint hypermobility, skin findings, and joint pains or recurrent dislocations. Hypermobile EDS and, less commonly, hypermobility spectrum disorders may also be associated with several extra-articular symptoms, including anxiety disorders, chronic pain, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction. The central goals of therapy are managing symptoms, preventing joint injury, and educating patients about their condition. Based on limited evidence, patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders may benefit from physical and occupational therapy, psychological support, and self-management. Primary care physicians play a key role not only in initial recognition, diagnosis, and patient education, but by virtue of their ongoing relationship they can also help oversee and coordinate the multidisciplinary team many of these patients require.",

Fatigue and other systemic symptoms that affect daily functioning may occur, as well. Accurate data on incidence and prevalence of HSDs is hampered by lack of awareness of these conditions and the wide heterogeneity of their clinical presentation. Identifying which type of HSD is present is important in guiding appropriate care. In particular, making the diagnosis of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is important, as individuals with hEDS may be at risk for more significant multisystem involvement. Diagnostic criteria for hEDS include measures of joint hypermobility, skin and other connective tissue findings, and lack of evidence of a different type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Beyond accurate diagnosis, HSDs pose many challenges for primary care providers, as ongoing patient education, patient empowerment, and coordination of a multidisciplinary treatment team are integral to proper care. This article describes the incidence and prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of HSDs, including clinical cases exemplifying how joint hypermobility might present within a primary care setting.",

Scoping Review and Expert Co-creation. United Kingdom, United States of America, Canada, France, Sweden, Luxembourg, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Co-creators (n = 15) included expertise from patients and clinicians from the International Consortium on the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders, facilitated by the Ehlers-Danlos Society. A scoping review using Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and CINHAL was conducted from May 2022 to September 2023. Articles were included if they reported primary research findings in relation to childbearing with hEDS/HSD, including case reports. No language limitations were placed on our search, and our team had the ability to translate and screen articles retrieved in English, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, Danish, German, and Portuguese. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess bias and quality appraise articles selected. The co-creation of guidelines was based on descriptive evidence synthesis along with practical and clinical experience supported by patient and public involvement activities. Primary research studies (n = 14) and case studies (n = 21) including a total of 1,260,317 participants informed the co-creation of guidelines in four overarching categories: 1) Preconceptual: conception and screening, 2) Antenatal: risk assessment, management of miscarriage and termination of pregnancy, gastrointestinal issues and mobility, 3) Intrapartum: risk assessment, birth choices (mode of birth and intended place of birth), mobility in labor and anesthesia, and 4) Postpartum: wound healing, pelvic health, care of the newborn and infant feeding. Guidelines were also included in relation to pain management, mental health, nutrition and the common co-morbidities of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, other forms of dysautonomia, and mast cell diseases. There is limited high quality evidence available. Individualized strategies are proposed for the management of childbearing people with hEDS/HSD throughout pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum period. A multidisciplinary approach is advised to address frequently seen issues in this population such as tissue fragility, joint hypermobility, and pain, as well as common comorbidities, including dysautonomia and mast cell diseases.",

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome presents with clinical sequela across multiple body systems that require multidisciplinary care. Little is known about adolescents with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome who are transgender and gender diverse. To date, there have been no reports of transgender and gender diverse youth in pediatric patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. The objective of this study was to characterize transgender and gender diverse adolescents with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome seen in a pediatric multidisciplinary specialty clinic. A retrospective chart review was performed and it was found that 28 patients were seen in the Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome multidisciplinary clinic were reported being transgender and gender diverse. Chart review included analysis of all documents in the electronic medical record, including demographic data, gender identity, chosen pronouns, specialty care previously received for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, symptoms and conditions related to it, and medications. Of the 166 total adolescents seen in the pediatric multidisciplinary Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome clinic during the study period, 17% reported gender dysphoria. The average age at Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome diagnosis was 13.5 years (range 8-17 years). Most (61%) reported their gender identity as transgender, followed by nonbinary (14%). Most had preferred male (he/him) pronouns (47%), followed by nonbinary (they/them) pronouns (39%). The vast majority reported fatigue (75%), musculoskeletal issues (96%), psychiatric issues (86%), cardiac issues (71%), gastrointestinal issues (68%), and neurologic issues (79%). Here we report the first cohort of transgender and gender diverse adolescents in the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome population and show an association between the two. This report increases awareness for providers who care for patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. As care for those with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is often complex and multidisciplinary, providers should adopt practices of gender-affirming medical care that contribute to improved care and outcomes.",

However, \"asymptomatic\" joint hypermobility may result in repetitive use injury, alter biomechanics of joints at other body sites, or become symptomatic later in life. Symptomatic joint hypermobility can result from soft-tissue rheumatism (e.g. bursitis, tendonitis, etc.) or muscular tension pain due to muscular imbalance. Generalized joint hypermobility (GJH) can be easily assessed using a standardized, quick, in-office examination. Management is relatively straight forward once joint hypermobility is recognized using neuromuscular re-training. It is important to recognize that GJH may also be a feature of a heritable connective tissue disorder with other systemic findings. Therefore, assessing joint hypermobility in those with musculoskeletal complaints may lead to recognizing systemic manifestations and allow the appropriate management.",

Diagnostic criteria, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and therapeutic considerations in patients with migraine and comorbid dysautonomia, HSD, and MCAS are reviewed. Numerous studies indicate a significant overlap and shared pathophysiology in migraine, dysautonomia, HSD, and MCAS. In clinical setting, dysautonomia, HSD, and MCAS may present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in patients with migraine and require a high index of suspicion on the part of the neurologist.

EDS need to be differentiated from other HCTDs with a variable clinical overlap including Marfan syndrome and related disorders, some types of skeletal dysplasia and cutis laxa. Clinical recognition of EDS is not always straightforward and for a definite diagnosis, molecular testing can be of great assistance, especially in patients with an uncertain phenotype. Currently, the major challenging task in EDS is to unravel the molecular basis of the hypermobile EDS that is the most frequent form, and for which the diagnosis is only clinical in the absence of any definite laboratory test. This EDS subtype, as well as other EDS-reminiscent phenotypes, are currently investigated worldwide to unravel the primary genetic defect and related pathomechanisms.

Within the multidisciplinary team, physical therapy plays a central role in management of individuals with hypermobility related disorders. However, many physical therapists are not familiar with the diagnostic criteria, prevalence, common clinical presentation, and management. This guideline aims to provide practitioners with the state of the art regarding the assessment and management of children, adolescents, and adults with JHS/hEDS. Due to the complexity of the symptoms in the profile of JHS/hEDS, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is adopted as a central framework whereby the umbrella term of disability is used to encompass functions, activities and participation, as well as environmental and personal factors. The current evidence-based literature regarding the management of JHS/hEDS is limited in size and quality and there is insufficient research exploring the clinical outcomes of a number of interventions. Multicenter randomized controlled trials are warranted to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions for children and adults. Until further multicenter trials are conducted, clinical decision-making should be based on theoretical and the current limited research evidence. For all individuals diagnosed with JHS/hEDS, international consensus and combined efforts to identify risk profiles would create a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms and the potential for optimizing health care for affected individuals. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

          "title": "How Is Variability in Femoral and Acetabular Version Associated With Presentation Among Young Adults With Hip Pain?",
          "abstract": "Acetabular and femoral version contribute to hip pain in patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) or dysplasia. However, definitions and measurement methods of femoral version have varied in different studies, resulting in different \"normal\" values being used by clinicians for what should be the same anatomic measurement. This could result in discrepant or even inappropriate treatment recommendations. In patients undergoing hip preservation surgery, (1) what is the range of acetabular and femoral version at presentation, and how much do two commonly used measurement techniques (those of Murphy and Reikerås) differ? (2) How are differences in acetabular and femoral version associated with clinical factors and outcomes scores at the time of presentation? This was a retrospective analysis of data gathered in a longitudinally maintained database of patients undergoing hip preservation at a tertiary care referral center. Between June 2020 and December 2021, 282 hips in 258 patients were treated for an isolated labral tear (9% [26 hips]), hip dysplasia (21% [59 hips]), FAI (52% [147 hips]), mixed FAI and dysplasia (17% [47 hips]), or pediatric deformity (slipped capital femoral head epiphysis or Perthes disease; 1% [3 hips]) with hip arthroscopy (71% [200 hips]), periacetabular osteotomy (26% [74 hips]), surgical hip dislocation (2.5% [7 hips]), or femoral derotation osteotomy (0.5% [1 hip]). We considered those with complete radiographic data (CT including the pelvis and distal femur) and patient-reported outcome scores as potentially eligible. Exclusion criteria were age younger than 18 or older than 55 years (5 hips, 3 patients), signs of hip osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade ≥ 2; 0), pediatric deformity (slipped capital femoral head epiphysis or Perthes disease; 3 hips, 3 patients), previous femoral or acetabular osteotomy (2 hips, 2 patients), avascular necrosis of the femoral head (0), history of neuromuscular disorder (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; 3 hips, 3 patients) or rheumatoid disease (ankylosing spondylitis; 1 hip, 1 patient), and when CT did not include the knees (19 hips, 19 patients). Based on these criteria, 249 hips in 227 patients were included. Of patients with bilateral symptomatic hips, one side was randomly selected for inclusion, leaving 227 hips in 227 patients for further analysis. The patients' median age (range) was 34 years (19 to 55 years), the median BMI (range) was 27 kg/m 2 (16 to 55 kg/m 2 ), and 63% (144) were female; they were treated with hip arthroscopy (in 74% [168]) or periacetabular osteotomy (in 23% [52]). Patients underwent a CT scan to measure acetabular version and femoral version using the Murphy (low < 10°; normal: 10° to 25°; high > 25°) or Reikerås (low < 5°; normal: 5° to 20°; high > 20°) technique. The McKibbin index was calculated (low: < 20°; normal: 20° to 50°; high > 50°). Based on the central acetabular version and femoral version as measured by Murphy, hips were grouped according to their rotational profile into four groups: unstable rotational profile: high (high acetabular version with high femoral version) or moderate (high acetabular version with normal femoral version or normal acetabular version with high femoral version); normal rotational profile (normal acetabular version with femoral version); compensatory rotational profile (low acetabular version with high femoral version or high acetabular version with low femoral version); and impingement rotational profile (low acetabular version with low femoral version): high (low acetabular version with low femoral version) or moderate (low acetabular version with normal femoral version or normal acetabular version with low femoral version). Radiographic assessments were manually performed on digitized images by two orthopaedic residents, and 25% of randomly selected measurements were repeated by the senior author, a fellowship-trained hip preservation and arthroplasty surgeon. Interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities were calculated using the correlation coefficient with a two-way mixed model, showing excellent agreement for Murphy technique measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.908 [95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.97]) and Reikerås technique measurements (ICC 0.938 [95% CI 0.81 to 0.97]). Patient-reported measures were recorded using the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33) (0 to 100; worse to best). The mean acetabular version was 18° ± 6°, and mean femoral version was 24° ± 12° using the Murphy technique and 12° ± 11° with the Reikerås method. Eighty percent (181 of 227) of hips had normal acetabular version, 42% (96 of 227) to 63% (142 to 227) had normal femoral version per Murphy and Reikerås, respectively, and 67% (152 to 227) had a normal McKibbin index. Patients with an impingement profile (low acetabular version or femoral version) were older (39 ± 9 years) than patients with an unstable (high acetabular version or femoral version; 33 ± 9 years; p = 0.004), normal (33 ± 9 years; p = 0.02), or compensatory (high acetabular version with low femoral version or vice versa; 33 ± 7 years; p = 0.08) rotational profile. Using the Murphy technique, femoral version was 12° greater than with the Reikerås method (R 2 0.85; p < 0.001). There were no differences in iHOT-33 score between different groups (impingement: 32 ± 17 versus normal 35 ± 21 versus compensated: 34 ± 20 versus unstable: 31 ± 17; p = 0.40). Variability in femoral version is twice as large as acetabular version. Patients with an impingement rotational profile were older than patients with a normal, compensatory, or unstable profile, indicating there are other variables not yet fully accounted for that lead to earlier pain and presentation in these groups. Important differences exist between measurement methods. This study shows that different measurement methods for femoral anteversion result in different numbers; if other authors compare their results to those of other studies, they should use equations such as the one suggested in this study.

We retrospectively reviewed outcomes of 45 women with VO-CPP who underwent treatment with iliac vein stenting and/or embolization. Patients completed symptom-severity questionnaires before and after treatment that assessed for pelvic pain, and multiple other symptoms, including brain fog, anxiety, depression, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, migraines and more. Patient age ranged from 18 to 65 years. The prevalence of common symptoms was as follows: migraines, 69%; brain fog, 76%; anxiety attacks, 58%; excess sweating, 64%; hip pain, 73%; diarrhea, 62%; constipation, 76%; and abdominal bloating, 82%. After treatment, most symptom scores improved by more than 50%; exceptions were excessive sweating (41% improvement) and bloating (47% improvement). Prevalence of individual symptoms that bundle into POTS ranged from 29% to 76%, where symptom improvement ranged from 23% to 59% after treatment. Overlapping individual symptoms characteristic of fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) were present in 64% to 82% of patients and all improved by 49% to 63% after treatment. Pelvic venous flow abnormality is linked causally to a spectrum of interrelated symptoms, of which many can be bundled into named syndromes of unknown cause.

The fascial origin of pain may correspond to changes in the extracellular matrix. The objective of this study was to investigate structural changes in fascia in hEDS. A series of 65 patients were examined prospectively-26 with hEDS, and 39 subjects with chronic neck, knee, or back pain without hEDS. The deep fascia of the sternocleidomastoid, iliotibial tract, and iliac fascia were examined with B-mode ultrasound and strain elastography, and the thicknesses were measured. Stiffness (strain index) was measured semi-quantitatively using elastography comparing fascia to muscle. Differences between groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. hEDS subjects had a higher mean thickness in the deep fascia of the sternocleidomastoid compared with non-hEDS subjects. There was no significant difference in thickness of the iliac fascia and iliotibial tract between groups. Non-hEDS subjects with pain had a higher strain index (more softening of the fascia with relative stiffening of the muscle) compared with hEDS subjects and non-hEDS subjects without back or knee pain. In myofascial pain, softening of the fascia may occur from increase in extracellular matrix content and relative increase in stiffness of the muscle; this change is not as pronounced in hEDS.",

In the presence of \"red flags\", further tests must be done to rule out underlying problems; however, biomedical imaging is currently overused. LBP involves large in-hospital and out-of-hospital economic costs, and it is also the most common musculoskeletal disorder seen in emergency departments (EDs). This retrospective observational study enrolled 1,298 patients admitted to the ED, including all International Classification of Diseases 10 diagnosis codes for sciatica, lumbosciatica, and lumbago. We collected patients' demographic data, medical history, lab workup and imaging performed at the ED, drugs administered at the ED, ED length of stay (LOS), numeric rating scale pain score, admission to ward, and ward LOS data. Thereafter, we performed a cost analysis. Mean numeric rating scale scores were higher than 7/10. Home medication consisted of no drug consumption in up to 90% of patients. Oxycodone-naloxone was the strong opioid most frequently prescribed for the home. Once at the ED, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates were administered to up to 72% and 42% of patients, respectively. Imaging was performed in up to 56% of patients. Mean ED LOS was 4 hours, 14 minutes. A total of 43 patients were admitted to a ward. The expense for each non-ward-admitted patient was approximately €200 in the ED, while the mean expense for ward-admitted patients was €9,500, with a mean LOS of 15 days. There is not yet a defined therapeutic care process for the patient with LBP with clear criteria for an ED visit. It is to this end that we need a clinical pathway for the prehospital management of LBP syndrome and consequently for an in-hospital time-saving therapeutic approach to the patient.",

Although education and feedback interventions are potential levers to affect opioid prescribing, their incremental contribution against a background of declining opioid prescriptions is unclear. We retrospectively evaluated opioid prescribing frequencies after an emergency physician-specific education and feedback initiative in an integrated health care system. We evaluated opioid prescriptions for adult patients discharged from 21 emergency departments (EDs) between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Applying interrupted time series methodology to account for time trends, we analyzed pre- to postintervention changes in prescribing of any opioid and in opioid prescriptions for greater than 20 tablets. We studied all ED visits, visits for back pain and acute extremity fracture, and visits stratified by physicians with high vs low frequency of opioid prescribing. We identified patient, physician, and visit characteristics associated with postintervention ED opioid prescriptions (2018). Of 1.01 million preintervention and 1.59 million postintervention ED visits, after adjusting for the background trend over time, the intervention was associated with a 3.4% decrease in frequency of opioid prescriptions post intervention (95% CI, -4% to -2.8%), with similar decreases in high-quantity prescriptions (> 20 tablets) and back pain- and acute extremity fracture-related ED visits. Postintervention adjusted analyses indicated no significant association between opioid prescription and race/ethnicity or prior history of opioid abuse. The ED Opioid Safety Initiative was associated with a near-term decrease in multiple categories of opioid prescribing, including for selected subgroups of common painful conditions.",

Globally, workplace violence (WPV) in EDs is a major challenge to safety for HCWs, involving significant consequences to the victims, patients, and healthcare organizations. We reviewed the current literature with the aim to explore the topics focused on and to detect new evidences about approaching the issue of WPV toward HCWs in EDs. A search for articles regarding WPV toward HCWs employed in EDs and published from January 2007 through December 2017 was performed; using predetermined criteria for inclusion, selected articles were reviewed and qualitatively assessed for the aims of the review. We found 60 papers which matched our inclusion criteria; the topics, discussed in order of frequency from highest to lowest, were: \"Risk Assessment\", \"Occurrence Rates\", \"Risk Management\", and \"Physical/non Physical Consequences\". Dementia, schizophrenia, anxiety, acute stress reaction, suicidal ideation, and alcohol and drug intoxication were found as predictors of physical violence perpetrated by patients against HCWs. A strategic way to the effective management of WPV should prioritize training courses focused on: constructing HCW-patient relationship, improving the workers' communication skills, accurate reporting of each violent incident, and improving the labor context through management commitment and employee involvement in WPV prevention programs. A special effort is required in implementing workplace design effective in minimizing stressful conditions in waiting rooms which turned out to be the most frequent site of assaults.",

          "abstract": "Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorders are the most common symptomatic joint hypermobility conditions seen in clinical practice. The 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes replaced previous terms for symptomatic joint hypermobility with hypermobile EDS and introduced the term hypermobility spectrum disorders for patients not meeting diagnostic criteria for hypermobile EDS. Both are diagnosed by applying the 2017 diagnostic criteria, which also excludes other less common conditions presenting with joint hypermobility such as other forms of EDS and heritable connective tissue disorders. Hypermobile EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but it does not have a known genetic mutation to help with diagnosis. Clinical features of hypermobile EDS include joint hypermobility, skin findings, and joint pains or recurrent dislocations. Hypermobile EDS and, less commonly, hypermobility spectrum disorders may also be associated with several extra-articular symptoms, including anxiety disorders, chronic pain, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction. The central goals of therapy are managing symptoms, preventing joint injury, and educating patients about their condition. Based on limited evidence, patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders may benefit from physical and occupational therapy, psychological support, and self-management. Primary care physicians play a key role not only in initial recognition, diagnosis, and patient education, but by virtue of their ongoing relationship they can also help oversee and coordinate the multidisciplinary team many of these patients require.",

          "abstract": "Chronic widespread pain is a common complaint among individuals affected by generalised joint hypermobility. In the absence of other conditions that cause chronic pain, these individuals are usually diagnosed with joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS). JHS is a multifactorial trait with a strong genetic basis, but no specific genetic markers. Clinical overlap of JHS is seen with heritable connective tissue disorders, particularly with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobile type (hEDS). The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of rare monogenic conditions that are characterised by joint hypermobility, skin and vascular fragility and generalised connective tissue friability, and are caused by genetic defects in an array of extracellular matrix genes. The genetic basis of hEDS remains however unknown, in contrast to other well-described EDS subtypes. In view of the considerable clinical overlap with JHS, many consider it and hEDS to be a single clinical entity. Clinical experience and a limited number of clinical studies show that chronic pain also is common in EDS patients, especially in hEDS. The specific underlying causes and mechanisms of pain in JHS and EDS remain poorly understood. Factors likely contributing to the generation and chronicity of pain include nociceptive pain, directly based on structural changes in affected joints, muscle and connective tissue; neuropathic pain; impaired proprioception and muscle weakness; and central sensitisation. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and likely more than one mechanism may be present. Furthermore, anxiety, depression, and other variables may influence the phenotype. Chronic pain in JHS and EDS patients often is inadequately controlled by traditional analgesics and physical therapy. In view of the high prevalence of these underrecognised conditions, future studies addressing the nature and mediators of chronic pain are needed in order to potentially identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention and optimise treatment.",

There are no clear guidelines for addressing orthopedic concerns or reporting surgical outcomes in this population. This article reviews the literature, reports on a new study, and offers considerations prior to surgical intervention. The new study seeks to determine the effectiveness of surgical intervention in individuals with EDS. It is a retrospective chart review of 154 individuals clinically diagnosed with EDS who had orthopedic surgery >2 years ago at Hospital for Special Surgery. A total of 120 individuals were included in the study. One hundred eleven females and 9 males underwent a total of 320 orthopedic surgeries, of which 204 surgeries had available post-operative follow-up. The average age at surgery was 38.2 years (range: 7.6-83.3). Multiple post-operative complications (290) were reported in 91% of cases. Common complications were persistent pain/discomfort (45), continued subluxation/dislocation (20), instability (19), pain/discomfort from hardware (17), and infection (16). Our results suggest that surgical outcomes are worse for individuals with EDS compared to the general population, a finding which is similar to other studies. Complications occurred more frequently in the EDS population than the average population, suggesting that surgery should be undertaken by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians with careful pre-operative planning and full knowledge of the risks and benefits. Guidelines for the care of this unique population must be established.",

Musculoskeletal complaints manifest with joint pain of non-inflammatory origin and/or spinal pain. Joint instability leads to dislocation or subluxation and involves peripheral joints as well as central joints, including the temporomandibular joints, sacroiliac joints, and hip joints. Soft tissue overuse injury may lead to tendonitis and bursitis without joint inflammation in most cases. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-HT carries a high potential for disability due to recurrent dislocations and subluxations and chronic pain. Throughout the years, extra-articular manifestations have been described, including cardiovascular, autonomic nervous system, gastrointestinal, hematologic, ocular, gynecologic, neurologic, and psychiatric manifestations, emphasizing the multisystemic nature of EDS-HT. Unfortunately, EDS-HT is under-recognized and inadequately managed, leading to neglect of these patients, which may lead to severe disability that almost certainly could have been avoided.

Unfortunately, both the mechanisms and treatments for pain are poorly understood. The proposed treatments for the various musculoskeletal pain syndromes in EDS have had variable success, and it becomes much more imperative to better define and evaluate the current treatment modalities in treating this debilitating disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the currently available treatment modalities for patients with EDS and their efficacies in pain and symptom relief. Retrospective cohort study. Institutional physical medicine and rehabilitation primary care clinic. All patients were seen between January 2015 and April 2019, in which 98 patients with EDS were identified through retrospective chart review. Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all patients provided written consent to be included in the study. We reviewed various treatment modalities, including complimentary/alternative treatments, opioids/opioid-like medications, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, physical therapy, occupational therapy, muscle relaxants, neuropathic modulators, steroids, surgery/procedures, and acetaminophen. Treatment methods were extracted from individual patient charts, and efficacy was grouped into 3 categories: improvement, no effect, or worsened symptoms. The most common treatments used were complimentary/alternative treatments (n = 88). Occupational therapy and bracing were the most effective options with 70% of patients reporting improvement. Neuropathic modulators were the least well tolerated with 47% of patients reporting adverse effects. Men were a small percentage of the study. Patients were not randomized, and pain score reporting was subjective. Patient data were extracted from a single practice setting. Timing and symptom onset were not measured. There is a relative paucity of published literature regarding the various treatment methods for EDS. Although our study is able to identify positive and negative trends with certain modalities, it is vital to understand that EDS is not a uniform diagnosis among patients, and that a combination of several different treatments usually is needed for optimal symptom control. Further research and investigation are necessary to develop a comprehensive treatment database for this complex condition.

Because of their low prevalence, not much progress has been made not only in improved diagnosis but also in our understanding of the biochemical basis and pathogenesis of these diseases in animals. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) described in dogs already in 1943 and later in cats has only minor impact on the well-being of the dog as its effects on skin of these animals are rather limited. The involved skin is thin and hyperextensible with easily inflicted injuries resulting in hemorrhagic wounds and atrophic scars. Joint laxity and dislocation common in people are less frequently found in dogs. No systemic complications, such as organ rupture or cardiovascular problems which have devastating consequences in people have been described in cats and dogs. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and on light or electron microscopic features of disorganized and fragmented collagen fibrils. Several case of bovine and ovine dermatosparaxis analogous to human Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC were found to be caused by mutations in the procollagen I N-proteinase (pnPI) or ADAMTS2 gene, though mutations in other sites are likely responsible for other types of dermatosparaxis. Cattle suffering from a form of Marfan syndrome (MFS) were described to have aortic dilatation and aneurysm together with ocular abnormalities and skeletal involvement. As in people, mutations at different sites of bovine FBN1 may be responsible for Marfan phenotype. Hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia (HERDA), or hyperelastosis cutis, has been recognized in several horse breeds as affecting primarily skin, and, occasionally, tendons. A mutation in cyclophilin B, a chaperon involved in proper folding of collagens, has been identified in some cases. Warmblood fragile foal syndrome (WFFS) is another Ehlers-Danlos-like disorder in horses, affecting primarily Warmbloods who present with skin fragility and joint hyperextensibility. Degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis (DSLD) affects primarily tendons and ligaments of certain horse breeds. Data from our laboratory showed excessive accumulation of proteoglycans in organs with high content of connective tissues. We have identified increased presence of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) in active foci of DSLD and an abnormal form of decorin in proteoglycan deposits. Our most recent data obtained from next generation sequencing showed disturbances in expression of genes for numerous proteoglycans and collagens.",

Orthostatic cerebral blood flow velocity was reduced in 79% of hEDS and correlated with orthostatic dizziness. The head-up tilt test revealed postural tachycardia syndrome (prevalence 33%), hypocapnic cerebral hypoperfusion (22%), orthostatic cerebral hypoperfusion syndrome (18%), and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (9%). Widespread but mild autonomic failure was present in 90% of hEDS patients on autonomic testing. Small fiber neuropathy using structural criteria was detected in 64%, and using combined structural and functional criteria in 82%.

It is unknown whether subjective dysautonomia obtained from autonomic questionnaires correlates with objective dysautonomia measured by quantitative autonomic testing. The objective of our study was to determine correlations between subjective and objective measures of dysautonomia. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital Autonomic Laboratory between 2017 and 2023 evaluating the patients who completed autonomic testing. Analyses included validated autonomic questionnaires [Survey of Autonomic Symptoms (SAS), Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31 (Compass-31)] and standardized autonomic tests (Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, sudomotor, and tilt test). The autonomic testing results were graded by a Quantitative scale for grading of cardiovascular reflexes, sudomotor tests and skin biopsies (QASAT), and Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS). Autonomic testing, QASAT, CASS, and SAS were obtained in 2627 patients, and Compass-31 in 564 patients. The correlation was strong between subjective instruments (SAS vs. Compass-31, r = 0.74, p < 0.001) and between objective instruments (QASAT vs. CASS, r = 0.81, p < 0.001). There were no correlations between SAS and QASAT nor between Compass-31 and CASS. There continued to be no correlations between subjective and objective instruments for selected diagnoses (post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, n = 61; postural tachycardia syndrome, 211; peripheral autonomic neuropathy, 463; myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, 95; preload failure, 120; post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, 163; hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 213; neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, 86; diabetes type II, 71, mast cell activation syndrome, 172; hereditary alpha tryptasemia, 45). The lack of correlation between subjective and objective instruments highlights the limitations of the commonly used questionnaires with some patients overestimating and some underestimating true autonomic deficit. The diagnosis-independent subjective-objective mismatch further signifies the unmet need for reliable screening surveys. Patients who overestimate the symptom burden may represent a population with idiosyncratic autonomic-like symptomatology, which needs further study. At this time, the use of autonomic questionnaires as a replacement of autonomic testing cannot be recommended.",

The objective of this study was to describe cerebrovascular, autonomic, and neuropathic features of hEDS. This retrospective case-control study was conducted at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital between 2016-2023. Data from hEDS patients who completed autonomic testing and skin biopsies were analyzed. Outcome measures include validated surveys (Survey of Autonomic Functions, Neuropathy Total Symptom Score-6 (SAS)) and autonomic function testing (Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, head-up tilt and sudomotor), cerebrovascular (cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the middle cerebral artery), respiratory (capnography), and neuropathic (skin biopsies for assessment of small fiber neuropathy) testing and inflammatory/ autoimmune markers. Total 270 hEDS patients were analyzed and compared to 29 healthy controls. Common hEDS complaints (prevalence > 90% ) were orthostatic sudomotor, vasomotor, gastrointestinal, and pain. Orthostatic cerebral blood flow velocity was reduced in 79% of hEDS and correlated with orthostatic dizziness. The head-up tilt test revealed postural tachycardia syndrome (prevalence 33%), hypocapnic cerebral hypoperfusion (22%), orthostatic cerebral hypoperfusion syndrome (18%), and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (9%). Widespread but mild autonomic failure was present in 90% of hEDS patients on autonomic testing. Small fiber neuropathy using structural criteria was detected in 64%, and using combined structural and functional criteria in 82%. This study provided evidence of cerebrovascular dysregulation with reduced orthostatic cerebral blood flow velocity associated with symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, frequent small fiber neuropathy, and widespread but mild autonomic failure in hEDS.",

          "abstract": "In 2022, nearly 0.5 million Canadians visited an emergency department (ED) for dizziness, accounting for over 3.5% of all ED visits. Of these patients, only 2%-5% received a serious diagnosis. The cost of ED and inpatient care for dizziness in Canada exceeds $200 million per year, of which neuroimaging accounts for a large proportion. Over one-third of dizziness patients undergo a CT scan of the head, 96% of which are negative. Despite extensive investigation, patients discharged with a benign dizziness diagnosis have a 50-fold increased risk of being admitted to the hospital within 7 days with a diagnosis of stroke. Our study aimed to derive a clinical risk score to guide the investigation and referral for serious causes of vertigo in ED patients. This multicenter historical cohort study was conducted over 7 years at three university-affiliated tertiary care EDs. Patients presenting with vertigo, dizziness, or imbalance were recruited. The main outcome was an adjudicated serious diagnosis, defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, vertebral artery dissection, or brain tumor. We estimated a sample size of 4450 patients, based on a 2% prevalence of serious outcomes, to evaluate the sensitivity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 4559 patients were enrolled (mean age 78.1 years, 57.8% women), with serious events occurring in 104 (2.3%) patients. The C-statistic was 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.98). The risk of a serious diagnosis ranged from 0% for a score of <5 to 16.7% for a score >8. Sensitivity for a serious diagnosis was 100% (95% CI 96.5%-100%) and specificity was 69.2% (95% CI 67.8%-70.51%) for a score <5. The Sudbury Vertigo Risk Score effectively identifies the risk of a serious diagnosis in patients with dizziness. Thus, it guides further investigation, consultation, and treatment decisions and ultimately improves resource utilization and reduces missed diagnoses.",

          "abstract": "Dizziness is a frequent presentation in patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs), often triggering extensive work-up, including neuroimaging. Therefore, gathering knowledge on final diagnoses and outcomes is important. We aimed to describe the incidence of dizziness as primary or secondary complaint, to list final diagnoses, and to determine the use and yield of neuroimaging and outcomes in these patients. Secondary analysis of two observational cohort studies, including all patients presenting to the ED of the University Hospital of Basel from 30th January 2017-19th February 2017 and from 18th March 2019-20th May 2019. Baseline demographics, Emergency Severity Index (ESI), hospitalization, admission to Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and mortality were extracted from the electronic health record database. At presentation, patients underwent a structured interview about their symptoms, defining their primary and secondary complaints. Neuroimaging results were obtained from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Patients were categorized into three non-overlapping groups: dizziness as primary complaint, dizziness as secondary complaint, and absence of dizziness. Of 10076 presentations, 232 (2.3%) indicated dizziness as their primary and 984 (9.8%) as their secondary complaint. In dizziness as primary complaint, the three (out of 73 main conditions defined) main diagnoses were nonspecific dizziness (47, 20.3%), dysfunction of the peripheral vestibular system (37, 15.9%), as well as somatization, depression, and anxiety (20, 8.6%). 104 of 232 patients (44.8%) underwent neuroimaging, with relevant findings in 5 (4.8%). In dizziness as primary complaint 30-day mortality was 0%. Work-up for dizziness in emergency presentations has to consider a broad differential diagnosis, but due to the low yield, it should include neuroimaging only in few and selected cases, particularly with additional neurological abnormalities. Presentation with primary dizziness carries a generally favorable prognosis lacking short-term mortality. .",

          "abstract": "To explore the prevalence of small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) and the clinical characteristics of patients with Tarlov cysts (PTCs), focusing on symptoms related to SFN and increased cerebrospinal pressure. In this retrospective study, 126 surveys assessing symptoms in women (30-69 years) with Tarlov cysts (TCs) ≥ 7 mm seeking treatment for chronic back, pelvic or leg pain and skin biopsy results from 75 patients assessing intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) were reviewed. IENFD < 5th percentile was documented in 80% of PTCs according to the normative reference data of Collongues et al and 72% according to the worldwide dataset of Lauria et al Questionnaires revealed high incidences of neuropathic pain (80%), allodynia (76%), pain while sitting (93%), anal sphincter (11%) and urinary sphincter (66%) problems, persistent genital arousal (27%), and restless legs (54%). Autonomic dysfunctions included early satiety (41%), bladder (93%) and bowel (88%) dysfunction, increased sweating (51%), and Raynaud's phenomenon (45%). Other symptoms potentially associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) were headaches (57%), fatigue (86%), cognitive issues (86%), and pulsatile tinnitus (59%). This study revealed a high prevalence of SFN in PTCs (72-80%). Although the TCs may not cause radicular pain in the corresponding dermatomes directly, individuals with TCs frequently report a range of symptoms that have previously been linked to symptomatic TCs, including bladder, bowel, sphincter, and sexual symptoms, as well as local pain. Additionally, seemingly unrelated symptoms, such as headaches, fatigue, cognitive difficulties, neuropathic pain localized in other parts of the body, and autonomic dysfunctions, are commonly reported. These symptoms may be associated with elevated CSFP within the nerve root sheath. Elevated pulsatile CSFP underlies the formation of TCs at the dorsal root ganglion and may gradually contribute to small-fiber dysfunction by irritating, compressing and damaging small nerve fibers within the dorsal root ganglion. : This study focused on how common small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is in patients with Tarlov cysts (TCs) and examined their symptoms, especially those linked to SFN and increased spinal fluid pressure. : Researchers reviewed surveys from 126 women (ages 30–69) with TCs larger than 7 mm who sought treatment for chronic back, pelvic, or leg pain. Skin biopsy results from 75 of these patients were also used to quantify small nerve fibers. : A reduction in nerve fiber count per mm skin, a sign of SFN, was found in 72–80% of patients. Common symptoms included nerve pain (80%), sensitivity to touch (76%), pain while sitting (93%), bladder problems (93%), bowel issues (88%), genital arousal (27%), and restless legs (54%). Many reported headaches (57%), fatigue (86%), memory difficulties (86%), and pulsating ear noise (59%). Other symptoms included autonomic dysfunctions (problems with the body’s automatic functions), such as sweating problems (51%), and circulation issues like Raynaud’s phenomenon (45%). : Most patients with TCs show signs of SFN and report various symptoms, including bladder, bowel, and sexual issues, as well as widespread nerve pain and other problems like fatigue and cognitive issues. These symptoms may be caused by increased spinal fluid pressure, which stretches the nerve coverings to form Tarlov cysts and also damages small nerves in the spinal canal. Over time, this pressure could lead to SFN.",

No previous literature about EDS and SIJ fusion is available. The purpose of this study was to assess our mid-term results of SIJ fusion surgery in EDS patients suffering from SIJ dysfunction. A case series of patients who underwent SIJ fusion for SIJ dysfunction due to EDS between January 2012 and December 2018 were analyzed in retrospect. Patients underwent surgery and the SIJ was stabilized with triangular implants bridging the joint. Pain and functional outcomes were assessed in nine agree/disagree questions and a satisfaction performance scale. Clinical data has been extracted from the patient files and in addition, we reassessed the position of the implants on the CT scans. A total of 16 patients with EDS completed the questionnaire and were available for analysis. The mean satisfaction score is 78.1 out of 100 and seven patients reported a 100% satisfaction score. SIJ fusion is a safe and useful procedure to reduce pain and function levels in EDS patients with lower back pain due to SIJ dysfunction.",

TCS is often radiographically occult in nature, not always detectable on standard imaging and presents with lower back pain, balance issues, weakness in the lower extremities, sensory loss, and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Cervical instability due to ligament laxity can lead to headaches, vertigo, tinnitus, vision changes, syncope, radiculopathy, pain, and dysphagia. TCS and cervical instability not only share clinical features but can also co-occur in hEDS patients, posing challenges in diagnostics and clinical management.

CCI is characterized by severe headache and neck pain, cervical medullary syndrome, lower cranial nerve deficits, myelopathy, and radiological metrics, for which occipital cervical fusion (OCF) has been advocated. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with CCI and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) to determine whether the surgical outcomes supported the criteria by which patients were selected for OCF. Fifty-three consecutive subjects diagnosed with EDS, who presented with severe head and neck pain, lower cranial nerve deficits, cervical medullary syndrome, myelopathy, and radiologic findings of CCI, underwent open reduction, stabilization, and OCF. Thirty-two of these patients underwent suboccipital decompression for obstruction of cerebral spinal fluid flow. Questionnaire data and clinical findings were abstracted by a research nurse. Follow-up questionnaires were administered at 5-28 months (mean 15.1). The study group demonstrated significant improvement in headache and neck pain (p < 0.001), decreased use of pain medication (p < 0.0001), and improved Karnofsky Performance Status score (p < 0.001). Statistically significant improvement was also demonstrated for nausea, syncope (p < 0.001), speech difficulties, concentration, vertigo, dizziness, numbness, arm weakness, and fatigue (p = 0.001). The mental fatigue score and orthostatic grading score were improved (p < 0.01). There was no difference in pain improvement between patients with CMI/LLCT and those without. This outcomes analysis of patients with disabling CCI in the setting of EDS demonstrated significant benefits of OCF. The results support the reasonableness of the selection criteria for OCF. We advocate for a multi-center, prospective clinical trial of OCF in this population.",

The temporal pattern of opioid prescribing in the context of the opioid epidemic remains unknown. To examine the temporal pattern of opioid prescribing within an ED for varying pain conditions between 2009 and 2018. A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted at the ED of an urban academic medical center. All patients treated within that ED between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, were included. The proportion of patients prescribed an opioid for treatment of pain in the ED temporally by condition, condition type, patient demographics, and physician prescriber. Between 2009 and 2018, 556 176 patient encounters took place in the ED, with 70 218 unique opioid prescriptions ordered. A total of 316 632 patients (55.9%) were female, 45 070 (42.6%) were of white race, and 43 412 (40.6%) were privately insured; the median age group was 41 to 45 years. Yearly opioid prescriptions decreased by 66.3% (from 16.3 to 5.5 opioids per 100 encounters) between 2013 and 2018, with a yearly adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.808 (95% CI, 0.802-0.814) compared with the prior year. In patients with musculoskeletal pain (back, joint, limb, and neck pain), opioid prescribing decreased by 71.1% (from 36.7 to 10.6 opioids per 100 encounters between 2013 and 2018; aOR, 0.758; 95% CI, 0.744-0.773). In patients with musculoskeletal trauma (fracture, sprain, contusion, and injury), opioid prescribing decreased by 58.0% (from 34.2 to 14.8 opioids per 100 encounters; aOR, 0.811; 95% CI, 0.797-0.824). In patients with nonmusculoskeletal pain (abdominal pain, kidney stone, respiratory distress, and pharyngitis) opioid prescribing decreased by 53.7% (from 20.1 to 9.3 opioids per 100 encounters; aOR, 0.850; 95% CI, 0.834-0.868). Between 2009 and 2018, patients who were black (aOR, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.741-0.779) and those who were Asian (aOR, 0.714; 95% CI, 0.665-0.764) had the lowest odds of receiving an opioid compared with other racial/ethnic groups. There was a substantial temporal decrease in the number of opioid prescriptions within this ED during the study period. This decrease was associated with substantial relative reductions in opioid prescribing for treatment of musculoskeletal pain compared with fractures and kidney stones.",

          "abstract": "Emergency departments (EDs) worldwide are facing increasing patient volumes and thus crowding, prolonged waiting times and rising healthcare costs. In France, ED visits rose from 8.5 to 16 million between 2014 and 2024. To address these challenges, several countries (including Australia, the UK and Canada) have integrated physiotherapists into EDs in advanced practice roles-primarily for musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions. In contrast, this type of integration is rare in the French healthcare system. The objective of the present study was to assess the attitudes of French emergency physicians to the incorporation of physiotherapists into ED teams. A nationwide, cross-sectional survey of emergency physicians practising in France was conducted between 22 November 2023 and 15 February 2024. The study questionnaire assessed the physicians' willingness to collaborate with physiotherapists, the perceived benefits of collaboration and views on task delegation. Descriptive statistics and χ² tests were used to analyse the data. Of the 420 respondents, 333 (79.3%) expressed willingness to collaborate with physiotherapists in EDs. The most commonly cited benefits were improved quality of care n=321 (76.4%), greater patient satisfaction n=318 (75.7%), a lower physician workload n=276 (67.5%) and enhanced ED efficiency n=211 (50.2%). The conditions most frequently considered for delegation included suspected ankle sprains n=313 (74.5%), knee sprains n=277 (66.0%) and lower back pain n=271 (64.5%). Compared with junior colleagues, senior physicians with five or more years of experience were significantly more supportive of delegating cases of neck pain (n=110, 41.7%, p=0.017). French emergency physicians are generally supportive of integrating physiotherapists into EDs, especially for the management of non-urgent MSK conditions. The physicians see physiotherapists as capable of providing on-site care and patient education, potentially improving patient flow and alleviating pressures in overcrowded EDs. These findings offer valuable insights for countries in which the integration of physiotherapy into emergency care is still emerging.",

The literature has described the diagnostic accuracy of alternative diagnostic modalities with promising evidence of its ability to mitigate health inequity in primary care. Our objective was to understand if racial disparity exists in radiography for pediatric fractures. In this four-year retrospective cohort study, we analyzed rates of radiographic imaging and abnormal radiograph detection in 4280 pediatric patients (ages 3-18 years) who presented with chief complaints of arm or wrist pain and trauma-related International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. We compared White children to all other races and stratified by emergency departments (ED) vs all other primary care ambulatory service lines.  Results: Non-White patients had lower imaging rate differences and lower odds receiving imaging in both ambulatory settings (0.65915, P = 0.0162; -5.4%, P = 0.0143) and in EDs (0.7732, P = 0.0369; -4.7%, P = 0.0368). Additionally, non-Whites in the ED had lower rates and lower odds of abnormal radiographs (-7.3%, P = 0.0084; 0.6794, P = 0.0089).  Conclusion: Non-White patients seen in emergency and ambulatory settings had lower imaging rates for traumatic arm and wrist pain compared to White patients, indicating a healthcare disparity in pediatric imaging. Higher-level studies investigating the effect of social determinants of health, more detailed patient data, and provider bias on facture care equity are needed to understand underlying reasons for observed differences.",

Thirty-eight individuals with hypermobile or classic EDS participated. The percentage of pain in the foot and deformities was recorded, and several questionnaires were administered. The type of foot was classified according to the footprint and the Foot Posture Index. There was a high degree of pain, disability, intensity of fatigue and low quality of life in these patients. According to the footprint, 20% presented flat feet, 47% normal feet and 33% cavus feet. The participants in this study had a high percentage of foot problems related to high levels of pain and limited functionality in the feet. The quality of life of these patients appeared diminished. Foot types were observed according to the footprint and deformities similar to those of the general population.",

Data from hEDS patients who completed autonomic testing and skin biopsies were analyzed. Outcome measures include validated surveys (Survey of Autonomic Functions, Neuropathy Total Symptom Score-6 (SAS)) and autonomic function testing (Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, head-up tilt and sudomotor), cerebrovascular (cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the middle cerebral artery), respiratory (capnography), and neuropathic (skin biopsies for assessment of small fiber neuropathy) testing and inflammatory/ autoimmune markers. Total 270 hEDS patients were analyzed and compared to 29 healthy controls. Common hEDS complaints (prevalence > 90% ) were orthostatic sudomotor, vasomotor, gastrointestinal, and pain. Orthostatic cerebral blood flow velocity was reduced in 79% of hEDS and correlated with orthostatic dizziness. The head-up tilt test revealed postural tachycardia syndrome (prevalence 33%), hypocapnic cerebral hypoperfusion (22%), orthostatic cerebral hypoperfusion syndrome (18%), and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (9%). Widespread but mild autonomic failure was present in 90% of hEDS patients on autonomic testing. Small fiber neuropathy using structural criteria was detected in 64%, and using combined structural and functional criteria in 82%.

There is phenotypic and genetic variation among the 13 subtypes. The initial genetic findings on EDS were related to alterations in fibrillar collagen, but the elucidation of the molecular basis of many of the subtypes revealed several genes not involved in collagen biosynthesis or structure. However, the genetic basis of the hypermobile type of EDS (hEDS) is still unknown. hEDS is the most common type of EDS and involves generalized joint hypermobility, musculoskeletal manifestations, and mild skin involvement along with the presence of several comorbid conditions. Variability in the spectrum and severity of symptoms and progression of patient phenotype likely depend on age, gender, lifestyle, and expression domains of the EDS genes during development and postnatal life.

Fourteen different types of EDS are recognized, of which the molecular cause is known for 13 types. These types are caused by variants in 20 different genes, the majority of which encode the fibrillar collagen types I, III and V, modifying or processing enzymes for those proteins, and enzymes that can modify glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans. For the hypermobile type of EDS, the molecular underpinnings remain unknown. As connective tissue is ubiquitously distributed throughout the body, manifestations of the different types of EDS are present, to varying degrees, in virtually every organ system. This can make these disorders particularly challenging to diagnose and manage. Management consists of a care team responsible for surveillance of major and organ-specific complications (for example, arterial aneurysm and dissection), integrated physical medicine and rehabilitation. No specific medical or genetic therapies are available for any type of EDS.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, an association between hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) has garnered attention and patients are increasingly presenting with this triad. However, a real relationship between these entities is unclear due to a lack of scientific validity. We conducted an extensive review of the literature using two different search strategies. A narrower strategy included 88 searches of various combinations of terms for each of the three conditions, yielding 19 unique papers. A broader search included 136 searches of various combinations of terms but included all forms of EDS and yielded 40 unique papers. Of these, only four and nine papers from the narrower and broader search strategies were original research articles. None of these papers resulted from a combination of the search terms for the three conditions. All three clinical entities are controversial in either existence or pathogenesis. MCAS is a poorly defined clinical entity, and many studies do not adhere to the proposed criteria when establishing the diagnosis. Patients previously diagnosed with EDS hypermobility type may not meet the new, stricter criteria for hEDS but may for a less severe hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD). The pathophysiology of POTS is still unclear. An evidence-based, common pathophysiologic mechanism between any of the two, much less all three conditions, has yet to be described. Our review of the literature shows that current evidence is lacking on the existence of MCAS or hEDS as separate or significant clinical entities. Studies proposing a relationship between the three clinical entities are either biased or based on outdated criteria. The reason behind the purported association of these entities stems from an overlapping pool of vague, subjective symptoms, which is inadequate evidence to conclude that any such relationship exists.",

          "abstract": "Autonomic symptom questionnaires are frequently used to assess dysautonomia. It is unknown whether subjective dysautonomia obtained from autonomic questionnaires correlates with objective dysautonomia measured by quantitative autonomic testing. The objective of our study was to determine correlations between subjective and objective measures of dysautonomia. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital Autonomic Laboratory between 2017 and 2023 evaluating the patients who completed autonomic testing. Analyses included validated autonomic questionnaires [Survey of Autonomic Symptoms (SAS), Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31 (Compass-31)] and standardized autonomic tests (Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, sudomotor, and tilt test). The autonomic testing results were graded by a Quantitative scale for grading of cardiovascular reflexes, sudomotor tests and skin biopsies (QASAT), and Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS). Autonomic testing, QASAT, CASS, and SAS were obtained in 2627 patients, and Compass-31 in 564 patients. The correlation was strong between subjective instruments (SAS vs. Compass-31, r = 0.74, p < 0.001) and between objective instruments (QASAT vs. CASS, r = 0.81, p < 0.001). There were no correlations between SAS and QASAT nor between Compass-31 and CASS. There continued to be no correlations between subjective and objective instruments for selected diagnoses (post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, n = 61; postural tachycardia syndrome, 211; peripheral autonomic neuropathy, 463; myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, 95; preload failure, 120; post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, 163; hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 213; neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, 86; diabetes type II, 71, mast cell activation syndrome, 172; hereditary alpha tryptasemia, 45). The lack of correlation between subjective and objective instruments highlights the limitations of the commonly used questionnaires with some patients overestimating and some underestimating true autonomic deficit. The diagnosis-independent subjective-objective mismatch further signifies the unmet need for reliable screening surveys. Patients who overestimate the symptom burden may represent a population with idiosyncratic autonomic-like symptomatology, which needs further study. At this time, the use of autonomic questionnaires as a replacement of autonomic testing cannot be recommended.",

While these chronic disorders arise from various pathophysiologic mechanisms, a shared autoimmune or immune-mediated etiology could shift the focus from symptomatic treatment of fatigue and pain to targeted immunomodulatory and biological therapy. A clinical paradigm shift is necessary to reevaluate CFS and fibromyalgia diagnoses and its relationship to the CDAF entities, which would ultimately lead to a change in diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for patients with chronic fatigue and chronic pain. Rather than uniformly apply the diagnoses of CFS or fibromyalgia to any patient presenting with unexplained chronic fatigue or chronic pain, it may be more beneficial and therapeutically effective to stratify these patients into more specific diagnoses in the CDAF group.",

Unfortunately, clinical guidance has been scarce, obsolete, or potentially harmful. Consequently, up to 91% of patients in the United States remain undiagnosed, and those diagnosed often receive inappropriate treatment. These problems are of increasing importance because after acute COVID-19, a significant percentage of people remain ill for many months with an illness similar to ME/CFS. In 2015, the US National Academy of Medicine published new evidence-based clinical diagnostic criteria that have been adopted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, the United States and other governments as well as major health care organizations have recently withdrawn graded exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy as the treatment of choice for patients with ME/CFS. Recently, 21 clinicians specializing in ME/CFS convened to discuss best clinical practices for adults affected by ME/CFS. This article summarizes their top recommendations for generalist and specialist health care providers based on recent scientific progress and decades of clinical experience. There are many steps that clinicians can take to improve the health, function, and quality of life of those with ME/CFS, including those in whom ME/CFS develops after COVID-19. Patients with a lingering illness that follows acute COVID-19 who do not fully meet criteria for ME/CFS may also benefit from these approaches.",

          "abstract": "A comprehensive review of scapular pathologies and their effect on shoulder function is necessary to determine the best treatment options. The coordinated motion between the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joints is essential for shoulder motion and depends on the balanced activity of the periscapular muscles. Disruption in these muscles can cause abnormal scapular motion and compensatory glenohumeral movements, leading to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. Scapular pathologies can arise from muscle overactivity or underactivity/paralysis, resulting in a range of scapulothoracic abnormal motion (STAM). STAM can lead to various glenohumeral pathologies, including instability, impingement, or nerve compression. It is important to highlight the critical periscapular muscles involved in scapulohumeral rhythm (such as the upper, middle, and lower trapezius; rhomboid major and minor; serratus anterior; levator scapulae; and pectoralis minor). A discussion of the different etiologies of STAM should include examples of muscle dysfunction, such as overactivity of the pectoralis minor, underactivity or paralysis of the serratus anterior or trapezius muscles, and dyskinesis resulting from compensatory mechanisms in patients with recurrent glenohumeral instability due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The evaluation and workup of STAM has shown that patients typically present with radiating shoulder pain, especially in the posterior aspect of the shoulder and scapula, and limitations in active shoulder overhead motion associated with glenohumeral pain, instability, or rotator cuff pathologies.",

Current practices rely on analgesics, physical therapy, bracing, and assistive devices. Dextrose prolotherapy (DPT) is a regenerative injection modality used to treat chronic painful musculoskeletal conditions through stimulation of tissue proliferation. The effectiveness of DPT for the treatment of chronic shoulder pain in patients with hEDS/HSD has not been established in the literature. Three patients with hEDS or HSD presented with refractory shoulder pain due to microinstability. Patients were treated with 20% DPT injected in the glenohumeral joint and surrounding structures as indicated. Outcomes assessed were pain and clinical improvement in joint stability at 2- to 7-week follow-up intervals. All patients reported subjective improvement in their shoulder pain and function. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores after DPT decreased from initial assessment in all patients. Patients reported a cumulative improvement in pain and joint stability with each injection. Regenerative treatment with DPT may help restore structural integrity of affected joints and serve as an adjunctive therapy for the management of chronic shoulder pain due to microinstability in patients with hEDS/HSD.",

          "abstract": "A subset of genetic conditions, particularly skeletal dysplasias, comprises a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders characterized by abnormal bone development, joint stiffness, and short stature. Their musculoskeletal manifestations frequently mimic those of rheumatic diseases, especially Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), complicating accurate diagnosis. We conducted a comprehensive clinical, radiological, and molecular evaluation of 47 individuals (23 males, 24 females) from 22 distinct families who presented primarily with non-inflammatory musculoskeletal complaints. Genomic investigations included targeted next-generation sequencing panels, chromosomal microarray analysis, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in all cases, establishing the following diagnoses: Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (n = 9), Camptodactyly-Arthropathy-Coxa Vara-Pericarditis syndrome (n = 12), Progressive Pseudorheumatoid Dysplasia (n = 7), Trichorhinophalangeal Syndrome types I/II (n = 5), Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with Immune Dysregulation (n = 6), Pseudoachondroplasia (n = 3), Primary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy type 1 (n = 1), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (n = 2), Multicentric Osteolysis-Nodulosis-Arthropathy (n = 1), and Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (n = 1). Certain genetic disorders may present with musculoskeletal manifestations that closely resemble those of rheumatic diseases. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation for underlying genetic causes is essential in patients with non-inflammatory skeletal findings, as it improves diagnostic precision and guides appropriate management strategies. This study aims to investigate the clinical and molecular features of patients with non-inflammatory musculoskeletal involvement, with a particular focus on the phenotypic overlap between genetic disorders and rheumatic diseases. Furthermore, seven novel variants were identified, expanding the mutational spectrum associated with these rare conditions and contributing new insights to the existing literature.",

The fascial origin of pain may correspond to changes in the extracellular matrix. The objective of this study was to investigate structural changes in fascia in hEDS. A series of 65 patients were examined prospectively-26 with hEDS, and 39 subjects with chronic neck, knee, or back pain without hEDS. The deep fascia of the sternocleidomastoid, iliotibial tract, and iliac fascia were examined with B-mode ultrasound and strain elastography, and the thicknesses were measured. Stiffness (strain index) was measured semi-quantitatively using elastography comparing fascia to muscle. Differences between groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. hEDS subjects had a higher mean thickness in the deep fascia of the sternocleidomastoid compared with non-hEDS subjects. There was no significant difference in thickness of the iliac fascia and iliotibial tract between groups. Non-hEDS subjects with pain had a higher strain index (more softening of the fascia with relative stiffening of the muscle) compared with hEDS subjects and non-hEDS subjects without back or knee pain. In myofascial pain, softening of the fascia may occur from increase in extracellular matrix content and relative increase in stiffness of the muscle; this change is not as pronounced in hEDS.",

          "abstract": "Emergency department (ED) triage substantially affects how long patients wait for care but triage scoring relies on few objective criteria. Prior studies suggest that Black and Hispanic patients receive unequal triage scores, paralleled by disparities in the depth of physician evaluations. To examine whether racial disparities in triage scores and physician evaluations are present across a multicenter network of academic and community hospitals and evaluate whether patients who do not speak English face similar disparities. This was a cross-sectional, multicenter study examining adults presenting between February 28, 2019, and January 1, 2023, across the Mass General Brigham Integrated Health Care System, encompassing 7 EDs: 2 urban academic hospitals and 5 community hospitals. Analysis included all patients presenting with 1 of 5 common chief symptoms. Emergency department nurse-led triage and physician evaluation. Average Triage Emergency Severity Index [ESI] score and average visit work relative value units [wRVUs] were compared across symptoms and between individual minority racial and ethnic groups and White patients. There were 249 829 visits (149 861 female [60%], American Indian or Alaska Native 0.2%, Asian 3.3%, Black 11.8%, Hispanic 18.8%, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander <0.1%, White 60.8%, and patients identifying as Other race or ethnicity 5.1%). Median age was 48 (IQR, 29-66) years. White patients had more acute ESI scores than Hispanic or Other patients across all symptoms (eg, chest pain: Hispanic, 2.68 [95% CI, 2.67-2.69]; White, 2.55 [95% CI, 2.55-2.56]; Other, 2.66 [95% CI, 2.64-2.68]; P < .001) and Black patients across most symptoms (nausea/vomiting: Black, 2.97 [95% CI, 2.96-2.99]; White: 2.90 [95% CI, 2.89-2.91]; P < .001). These differences were reversed for wRVUs (chest pain: Black, 4.32 [95% CI, 4.25-4.39]; Hispanic, 4.13 [95% CI, 4.08-4.18]; White 3.55 [95% CI, 3.52-3.58]; Other 3.96 [95% CI, 3.84-4.08]; P < .001). Similar patterns were seen for patients whose primary language was not English. In this cross-sectional study, patients who identified as Black, Hispanic, and Other race and ethnicity were assigned less acute ESI scores than their White peers despite having received more involved physician workups, suggesting some degree of mistriage. Clinical decision support systems might reduce these disparities but would require careful calibration to avoid replicating bias.",

The connection between psychiatric morbidity and HG has been debated, but only a few studies have focused on eating disorders (EDs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between HG and both pre-pregnancy and new post-pregnancy EDs. A register-based controlled study. HG diagnoses were retrieved from healthcare registers between 2005 and 2017. Women with HG in their first pregnancy resulting in delivery were chosen as cases (n = 4265; the HG group) and women with no HG as controls (n = 302,663; the non-HG group). The associations between EDs and HG were analyzed by binary logistic regression, adjusted with age, body mass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, and pre-pregnancy psychiatric diagnoses. In the HG group, 1.6% and in the non-HG group, 0.2% had a pre-pregnancy ED. Women with ED were more likely to have HG in their first pregnancy compared with women with no history of EDs (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 9.4, 95% CI 6.52-13.66, p < .0001). Moreover, 0.4% of the women in the HG group and 0.1% of the women in the non-HG group had a new ED diagnosis after pregnancy, and thus the women in the HG group were more likely to have an ED diagnosis after pregnancy (AOR I 3.5, 95% CI 1.71-7.15, p < .001, AOR II 2.7, 95% CI 1.30-5.69, p = .008). We found a bidirectional association between ED and HG, suggesting a shared etiology or risk factors between these disorders. This finding emphasizes the importance of collaboration across various specialties when treating these patients. Our findings suggest a bidirectional association between HG and EDs before and after pregnancy. This finding provides essential information for healthcare professionals working with pregnant women. As both of these disorders are known to have far-reaching effects on the lives of both the mother and her offspring, our results help clinicians to target special attention and interventions to the patients suffering from these disorders.",

          "abstract": "Chronic widespread pain is a common complaint among individuals affected by generalised joint hypermobility. In the absence of other conditions that cause chronic pain, these individuals are usually diagnosed with joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS). JHS is a multifactorial trait with a strong genetic basis, but no specific genetic markers. Clinical overlap of JHS is seen with heritable connective tissue disorders, particularly with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobile type (hEDS). The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of rare monogenic conditions that are characterised by joint hypermobility, skin and vascular fragility and generalised connective tissue friability, and are caused by genetic defects in an array of extracellular matrix genes. The genetic basis of hEDS remains however unknown, in contrast to other well-described EDS subtypes. In view of the considerable clinical overlap with JHS, many consider it and hEDS to be a single clinical entity. Clinical experience and a limited number of clinical studies show that chronic pain also is common in EDS patients, especially in hEDS. The specific underlying causes and mechanisms of pain in JHS and EDS remain poorly understood. Factors likely contributing to the generation and chronicity of pain include nociceptive pain, directly based on structural changes in affected joints, muscle and connective tissue; neuropathic pain; impaired proprioception and muscle weakness; and central sensitisation. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and likely more than one mechanism may be present. Furthermore, anxiety, depression, and other variables may influence the phenotype. Chronic pain in JHS and EDS patients often is inadequately controlled by traditional analgesics and physical therapy. In view of the high prevalence of these underrecognised conditions, future studies addressing the nature and mediators of chronic pain are needed in order to potentially identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention and optimise treatment.",

This study aimed to clarify the actual prevalence of burnout and its associated factors among Japanese EPs. We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire study of selected 27 Japanese emergency departments (EDs). We examined the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey score and its associations with ED-level- and EP-level factors in a multivariable analysis. A total of 267 EPs (81.9%) completed survey. Of these, 43 EPs (16.1%) scored severe emotional exhaustion (EE), 53 (19.8%) scored severe depersonalization (DP), and 179 (67.0%) scored severe personal accomplishment (PA), and 24 (8.9%) scored severely in all three domains. In our multivariable analysis, emergency medical service centers were associated with severe PA scores (odds ratio [OR], 10.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78-62.66;  Our results suggest that 8.9% of Japanese EPs are in higher degrees of burnout. In particular, Japanese EPs scored more severely on PA. To avoid burnout in Japanese EPs, it is important to improve the working environment by ensuring more than 6 h of sleep, providing more support for young EPs, and taking effective action to combat low EP self-esteem.",

However, trends of emergency and acute care in China haven't been studied systematically. Relevant literature was carefully reviewed, including original and review articles, letters, government reports, yearbooks, both in Chinese and in English. Data on the number of emergency visits, physicians and beds in emergency departments (EDs), and the workforce of pre-hospital emergency care were summarized and analyzed from  Over the past decade, the number of ED visits tripled from 51.9 million to 166.5 million; and utilization of pre-hospital emergency care increased from 3.2 million to 6.8 million. In response to rapid increases in demand, the number of licensed emergency physicians raised from 20,058 to 59,409; the beds' number increased from 10,783 to 42,367. For pre-hospital emergency care, the volume of health workforce increased from 3,687 to 8,671, with a 109% increase in the number of physicians from 1,774 to 3,712. However, overcrowding, the long length of stay in EDs, poor work environment, and work exhaustion were still the critical challenges faced by China's EMSS. The number of emergency visits has grown with continual capability enhancement during the past decade. However, overcrowding, the long length of stay in EDs, poor work environment, and work exhaustion still need to be solved by China's EMSS. These findings and comparison with the USA could offer experiences and lessons to EMSS development worldwide, especially for developing countries.",

          "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, a large volume of COVID-19 patients were referred to hospital emergency departments (EDs). This increased job demand and job strain among ED nurses, resulting in a high risk of intention to leave their organization. To investigate turnover intention during the COVID-19 pandemic among ED nurses and examine the effect of organizational resources, maladaptive regulation, and job burnout on nurses' turnover intention. This cross-sectional study investigated 322 ED nurses. We divided participants into two groups: dark-red zone areas (pandemic crisis areas) and non-red zone areas (non-pandemic crisis areas). Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression (forward stepwise method) were used to analyze factors that predicted turnover intention. Most participants were female and the mean age was 34.54 years. During COVID-19 pandemic crisis, 72.8% of ED nurses in dark-red zone areas desired to leave their organization. The factors of motivation, exhaustion, and cognitive impairment positively influenced turnover intention among ED nurses in dark-red zone areas. Low availability of organizational resources was associated with an increase in the turnover intention rate. Maladaptive regulation, exhaustion, and cognitive impairment positively influenced turnover intention among ED nurses in non-red zone areas. Exhaustion and cognitive impairment stand as significant facets of burnout linked to the intention of turnover among ED nurses. To address this, we recommend fostering secure workplace settings and implementing interventions that alleviate job demands and strains for ED nurses, potentially reducing turnover intentions.",

We employed a systematic approach that followed PRISMA guidelines, searching through four major electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Science Direct, and PsychINFO) for relevant titles/abstracts published from January 1980-June 2021. We included original studies that explicitly mentioned the investigation of a potential association between SI/SB and demoralization. A total of 18 studies met our inclusion criteria. Their synthesis revealed that demoralization can be associated with SI/SB in a wide range of populations (community dwellers, patients with somatic or psychiatric disorders) and lead to significantly higher suicide risk (odds ratios of >6 were encountered in community dwellers experiencing financial hardship or isolation). Moreover, demoralization alone (about half the patients who were demoralized did not meet the criteria for an affective disorder nor were they clinically depressed) or together with depression has been identified as a major risk factor for SI/SB. Regarding the crucial issue of progression from SI to SA, in the context of the \"ideation-to-action\" frame, some authors found that the interaction of demoralization and over-arousal could be a useful predictor for this progression, while others found that depression alone was sufficient to differentiate attempters from non-attempters or the interaction with shutdown (helplessness and low positive emotions). These results emphasize the possibility to identify demoralization as an independent risk factor for suicide. In patients with psychiatric disorders, the association between demoralization and SI/SB may be transnosographic. Overall, from the clinical implications perspective, our findings highlight that: i. Assessment of demoralization may contribute to a more comprehensive suicide risk detection. This appears particularly relevant in Emergency Departments (EDs) where heterogeneous population typologies are usually admitted and a clinical diagnosis of depression is often difficult to be defined. ii. Additionally, since meaninglessness is considered one of the demoralization subcomponents, meaning-centered psychotherapeutic approaches prove to be indicated and they can be initiated already at the EDs upon first contact with the patient. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",

This study aimed to identify whether differences occurred in 115 self-reported symptoms and comorbidities in patients diagnosed with hEDS or HSD. In this study we analysed self-reported data from an EDS Clinic intake questionnaire in patients diagnosed with hEDS, HSD or no hypermobile conditions. From 1 November 2019 to 7 March 2024, the EDS Clinic saw 2088 patients. Using the 2017 diagnostic criteria, 66.5% were diagnosed with HSD ( Although we found an overlap in some symptoms and comorbidities self-reported by hEDS/HSD patients, such as allergy/atopy, headache/migraine and gastrointestinal symptoms, our findings suggest key differences exist between the two diagnoses, suggesting that hEDS and HSD may be distinct conditions.",

          "abstract": "Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is an immune disease with an estimated prevalence of 17%. Mast cell chemical mediators lead to heterogeneous multisystemic inflammatory and allergic manifestations. This syndrome is associated with various neurologic and psychiatric disorders, including headache, dysautonomia, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and many others. Although MCAS is common, it is rarely recognized, and thus, patients can suffer for decades. The syndrome is caused by aberrant mast cell reactivity due to the mutation of the controller gene. A case series is presented herein including eight patients with significant neuropsychiatric disorders that were often refractory to standard medical therapeutics. Five patients had depression, five had generalized anxiety disorder, and four had panic disorder. Other psychiatric disorders included attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, phobias, and bipolar disorder. All eight patients were subsequently diagnosed with mast cell activation syndrome; six had comorbid autonomic disorders, the most common being postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; and four had hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. All patients experienced significant improvements regarding neuropsychiatric and multisystemic symptoms after mast-cell-directed therapy. In neuropsychiatric patients who have systemic symptoms and syndromes, it is important to consider the presence of an underlying or comorbid MCAS.",

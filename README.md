> **Data explorations for the curious**

A collection of personal explorations driven by questions that kept me up at
night or sparked during random conversations. These projects are my attempts to
understand interesting patterns in the world.

### Temporal Clustering of Economic Breakthroughs

Economist Joseph Schumpeter developed the theory of "creative destruction" to
explain how innovation unfolds in waves rather than continuously. Turns out,
major breakthroughs often happen almost simultaneously by different people
working independently—like Darwin and Wallace both developing evolution theory
in the 1850s, or Newton and Leibniz both discovering calculus around the same
time. Bell and Gray even filed telephone patents on the exact same day in 1876.

The pharmaceutical industry had its own remarkable cluster. During the **Golden
Age of Antibiotics** (roughly 1940s to mid-1960s), scientists discovered nearly
two-thirds of all the antibiotic classes we still use today—an explosion of
discovery packed into just a couple of decades.

Using patent data, I analyzed trends in the types of patents being filed over
time. I also looked at FDA drug approvals to see if this clustering pattern
holds up and whether we can spot similar innovation waves in drug discovery.

_Key concept: Multiple discovery suggests that when the time is right—when
enough foundational knowledge exists—breakthroughs become almost inevitable,
discovered by multiple people working independently._

### Mining Social Media for Under-Reported Drug Side Effects

In pharma, side effects are usually discovered through clinical trials and
formal adverse event reports that doctors and patients fill out. But let's be
honest—that's a huge barrier.

Social media, on the other hand, has a much lower barrier to reporting. People
freely share their health experiences online every day. I got curious: could we
find side effects that are under-reported or under-researched by listening to
what people are already saying?

I built a tool to analyze Reddit discussions and uncover potential connections
between drugs and side effects that might be flying under the radar of
traditional pharmacovigilance systems.

### Personal Statistics & Existential Math

Some questions just pop into your head and won't leave. These projects explore
the mathematical side of existence—the statistical privileges we take for
granted and the curious milestones we pass without noticing.

- What are the odds I was born in my country versus somewhere without clean
  water or reliable electricity?
- When did my heart beat for the millionth time?
- What's my statistical death date based on actuarial tables?

**A Note on Accuracy**  
These are passion projects born from curiosity, not rigorous academic research.
I'm learning as I go, and while I try to be accurate, I'm not an expert in these
fields :) If you spot errors or have suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

      "title": "The Hatch-Waxman Era",
      "subtitle": "Generic Drug Revolution",
      "description": "This decade was defined by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Act), which fundamentally transformed the pharmaceutical landscape. The legislation created the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) pathway, dramatically lowering barriers for generic drug approvals. This led to an explosion of drug applications as companies rushed to bring affordable generic versions of off-patent medications to market, while also establishing modern patent protections for innovator drugs.",

      "title": "The Biotech Boom",
      "subtitle": "Blockbuster Drug Era",
      "description": "The turn of the millennium marked the golden age of pharmaceutical innovation, driven by advances in biotechnology, genomics, and rational drug design. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 streamlined approval processes, while the completion of the Human Genome Project opened new therapeutic frontiers. This era saw the rise of blockbuster drugs generating billions in annual revenue, including breakthrough treatments for chronic conditions affecting millions of Americans.",

      "why_it_matters": "This cluster exemplifies peak pharmaceutical profitability and innovation convergence. The 7,727 approvals reflected intense competition to develop chronic disease treatments for aging populations in developed nations. However, this era also foreshadowed challenges ahead: rising drug costs, patent cliffs, and questions about therapeutic innovation versus market segmentation."

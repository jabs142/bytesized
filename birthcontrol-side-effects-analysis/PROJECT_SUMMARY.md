# Birth Control Side Effects Pattern Explorer
## Discovering Hidden Symptom Relationships from Real Experiences

---

## 📋 Project Overview

An educational data science project that analyzes 537+ Reddit posts to discover hidden symptom patterns in birth control experiences. Following the **EDS symptom discovery methodology**, we use:

1. **LLM-Based Extraction**: GPT-4 extracts side effects without predefined keywords (unbiased discovery)
2. **PubMed Validation**: Cross-references each side effect with medical research
3. **Evidence Tiering**: Classifies findings by evidence strength (FDA-listed → Research-backed → Patient-validated → Emerging)
4. **Statistical Validation**: Rigorous analysis using Spearman correlation, chi-square tests, and Bonferroni correction
5. **Pattern Mining**: Association rule mining to find symptom co-occurrences

The project combines multi-source validation with interactive visualization to surface side effects that clinical trials might miss.

**Live Demo**: http://localhost:8000 (when running locally)

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Clinical trials for birth control typically:
- Focus on isolated side effects
- May miss symptom co-occurrences
- Don't capture long-term or "hidden" symptoms
- Have limited diversity in participants

Real-world experiences on Reddit reveal patterns that deserve investigation:
- Which symptoms tend to appear together?
- What's the strength of these relationships?
- Which combinations are more common than random chance?

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Data Collection Pipeline**
- Collects posts from 4 subreddits (r/birthcontrol, r/PMDD, r/TwoXChromosomes, r/SkincareAddiction)
- Deduplication to avoid double-counting
- PII removal (usernames, emails, phone numbers)
- Expandable keyword search (mental + physical symptoms)

### 2. **LLM-Based Side Effect Extraction** ✨ NEW
- Uses GPT-4 to extract ALL side effects without predefined keywords
- Captures patient's exact wording and context
- Discovers truly novel side effects that keyword-based approaches miss
- Standardizes variations into canonical medical terms
- Categorizes as mental vs physical

### 3. **PubMed Research Validation** ✨ NEW
- Searches PubMed for each side effect + birth control using E-utilities API
- Fetches paper details: title, abstract, authors, year, PMID, DOI
- Extracts prevalence data from abstracts (e.g., "67% of patients...")
- Identifies research gaps (high patient reports, low research coverage)

### 4. **Evidence Tiering System** ✨ NEW
- **Tier 1 🏆**: FDA-listed side effects (nausea, headache, mood changes, etc.)
- **Tier 2 ✅**: Research-backed (3+ PubMed papers found)
- **Tier 3 💬**: Patient-validated (50+ Reddit mentions, <3 papers)
- **Tier 4 ⚠️**: Emerging patterns (needs more investigation)
- **Surprise Score**: (Patient frequency) × (1 - Research coverage) to find hidden side effects

### 5. **Statistical Validation** ✨ NEW
- **Spearman Correlation**: Patient frequency vs research coverage
- **Chi-Square Tests**: Distribution analysis and tier associations
- **Bonferroni Correction**: Multiple testing correction to avoid false positives
- **Confidence Intervals**: Quantify uncertainty in findings
- Rigorous validation ensures patterns aren't due to random chance

### 6. **Pattern Mining**
- **Association Rule Mining** using Apriori algorithm
- Metrics calculated:
  - **Support**: How many posts contain the pattern?
  - **Confidence**: If symptom A appears, what % also have symptom B?
  - **Lift**: How much stronger is this pattern than random chance?
- Configurable thresholds (min support: 3%, min confidence: 60%, min lift: 1.2x)

### 4. **Interactive Web App**
- **Home Page**: Statistics dashboard with top symptoms
- **Symptom Checker**: Select symptoms → discover related patterns
- **Network Visualization**: Interactive D3.js force-directed graph
- Mobile-first, touch-friendly design
- No tracking, fully anonymous

## 📖 Key Concepts

### Association Rule Mining

**What is it?**
A data mining technique to find interesting relationships between items in large datasets.

**Example**:
If 65% of people who report "brain fog" also report "anxiety", and this is 1.9x more likely than random chance, that's a strong association rule.

### Metrics Explained

#### Support
**Definition**: How frequently the pattern appears in the dataset
**Formula**: (# posts with pattern) / (# total posts)
**Example**: 13 posts out of 386 = 3.4% support
**Interpretation**: Higher = more common pattern

#### Confidence
**Definition**: Conditional probability - if A occurs, what % also have B?
**Formula**: P(B|A) = (# posts with A and B) / (# posts with A)
**Example**: 65% of brain fog posts also mention anxiety
**Interpretation**: Higher = stronger relationship

#### Lift
**Definition**: How much more likely is B when A is present vs random?
**Formula**: Confidence(A→B) / Support(B)
**Example**: Lift = 1.9 means 90% more likely than random
**Interpretation**:
- Lift < 1.0 = Negative association (avoid each other)
- Lift = 1.0 = Independent (no relationship)
- Lift > 1.0 = Positive association (appear together)
- Lift > 1.5 = Strong association
- Lift > 2.0 = Very strong association

### Apriori Algorithm

**How it works**:
1. Find all frequent 1-itemsets (individual symptoms above min support)
2. Use frequent 1-itemsets to find frequent 2-itemsets
3. Continue building up to k-itemsets
4. Generate rules from frequent itemsets
5. Filter by confidence and lift

**Why it's efficient**:
The "Apriori principle" - if an itemset is infrequent, all its supersets are also infrequent. This allows aggressive pruning.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Collection Ethics
- ✅ Public posts only (no DMs or private subs)
- ✅ Anonymized (usernames removed)
- ✅ Rate-limited (2 seconds between requests)
- ✅ Deduplication (no double-counting)
- ✅ Educational use only

### Symptom Extraction Process
1. **Pattern matching**: Regex for exact symptom terms
2. **Context validation**: Ensure it's an experience, not a question
3. **Standardization**: Map variants to canonical terms (e.g., "acne" = "breakouts" = "pimples")
4. **Categorization**: Mental vs physical
5. **Temporal markers**: Extract timeline information

### Pattern Mining Parameters

**Current Settings**:
- Min Support: 11 posts (3% of 386)
- Min Confidence: 60%
- Min Lift: 1.2x

**Rationale**:
- Support threshold prevents rare flukes
- Confidence ensures reliability
- Lift ensures it's better than random

**Adjusting Thresholds**:
- Lower support → Find rarer patterns (but less reliable)
- Lower confidence → More patterns but weaker relationships
- Lower lift → Include weaker associations

## ⚠️ Limitations & Disclaimers

### Important Notes
- **NOT MEDICAL ADVICE**: This is for educational purposes only
- **Self-reported data**: Reddit posts are subjective experiences
- **Selection bias**: People with negative experiences may post more
- **Causation ≠ Correlation**: Patterns don't prove birth control caused symptoms
- **Small dataset**: 537 posts is not representative of all users
- **Missing context**: We don't have medical histories, diagnoses, or other medications

### Statistical Limitations
- Association rules don't prove causation
- Confidence intervals not calculated
- No control group
- Temporal relationships not established
- Confounding variables not controlled

### Use Cases
✅ **Appropriate Uses**:
- Generating hypotheses for research
- Patient education and awareness
- Identifying topics for doctor discussions
- Learning data science techniques

❌ **Inappropriate Uses**:
- Making medical decisions
- Diagnosing conditions
- Avoiding prescribed medications
- Replacing clinical trials

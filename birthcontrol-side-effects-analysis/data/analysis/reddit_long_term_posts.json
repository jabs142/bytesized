My doctor told me that nothing has changed with the pill itself just the advice on it and also told me the reason why it was initially advised that women took a 1 week break and it was pretty interesting\n\nApparently it’s because back in the day, when people were more religious, they advised the 1 week break so that the Catholics wouldn’t know that women were taking the contraceptive pill.. I think that’s wild and have never heard that before! Maybe she was just bullshitting me, has anyone else heard this before? ",

    "selftext": "Tl;dr (edit): my life has changed for the better. This isn't an attack on Yas/Yaz for anyone planning to get on it or who is using it. I benefitted greatly myself for years. It just didn't work *for me* anymore. \n\nI (28) was prescribed Yasmin in 2019 to deal with debilitating cystic acne and dysmenhorrea (extremely heavy and painful periods, running thru jumbo tampons every 2 hours, lasting 2-3 weeks sometimes)\nThe pill gave me my life back - no more painful cystic acne, no more cramps, periods that lasted a regular time. I was working better, feeling better, and even lost weight. I swore never to get off it unless I was planning a child\n\nThen everything changed. I moved continents in 2021 and before I left, my gyn forced me to \"take a break\" for a month and threatened to stop my prescription otherwise. This month coincided with my move across the world during the pandemic. In retrospect, damn, was I metal as hell for that. \n\nWhen I restarted the pill, I started getting cramps again and the bleeding reduced a lot more. My gyn and GP changed my pill to Yaz. The cramping went down, but the bleed was barely there.\nWith other life things happening to me I felt my mental health worsen. All my doctors and therapists chocked it to life events, undiagnosed mental illnesses, etc. I also developed hypothyroidism. \n\nI thought - lemme get off this pill to assess my body (for the lack of a better term) at factory settings. At this point I was taking so many meds it was overwhelming. But my specialists (gyn and endo) from home still refused to let me get off the pill, fearing that I will \"stop menstruating altogether\" thanks to my obesity.\n\nBut in February with the support of my GP where I live now, I decided for myself just to stop. And fuck, it's now June. My periods are back to normal, but it's nothing like I've ever experienced before. I'm back to bleeding fully (slightly heavy), but my cramps have almost disappeared altogether! On day 1 I have discomfort and some cramping, but it is nothing like it used to be. Dealing with a full bleed after 6 years off the pill has been challenging ofc, I've had to overhaul my products and managing the physicality of it all feels like a second puberty. But I still have little to no acne (environment ig?), and I feel like MYSELF again. In tune with my emotions, no longer numbed out. My mental health has improved so drastically I cannot even begin to describe it.\n\nIf you've been a long time user and are considering getting off for non-conception reasons, I'm happy to share more!",

Personally, I am very pro birth control and always the first to give a rebuttal to people who claim it’s poison for your body or “changes you” (beyond just typical side effects) but I had a really bad experience on Yaz. I think its combo of estrogen plus an anti-androgenic progestin makes it really a bad fit for some (not all) people. I’ve realized over time that my body needs some androgenic balance and I think that’s why I felt such intense effects from it. No other birth control pill, besides Yasmin and other variants or generics of Yaz, has quite that strong of an anti-androgenic combo. It makes sense why some people experience very noticeable and undesirable side effects then, since it doesn’t really replicate everyone’s natural hormones and may feel like an abrupt change. \n\nOf course to whoever reading this, YMMV—not everyone seems to be affected by androgenic content of pills and things. But some people really are and for those of us who are and who have taken Yaz, I think we can agree that quitting made quite the difference!",

It really made me feel better functionally as a person.\n\n\nHowever, I didnt know they were still making it? Or maybe they quit and restarted it. \n\nI stopped birth control after college and then went to restart when I started dating my now husband.

I am about to turn 21 and decided to go off of the pill a couple of months ago to see how my body/skin would react without the pill now that I am more physically developed. \n\nJust to note: I’m pretty sure I have PCOS, but doctors never got around to diagnosing before they decided to put me on the pill and let it ride.\n\nMy period is about 25 days late. I got cramps during the days before I was supposed to get my last period and I was almost certain I was about to start, but I never did. My drive has been through the roof… the highest it’s been since I was a younger teenager for sure. Energy levels are not as consistent and I am having some more periods (no pun intended) of depression than I usually do this time of year.  My recovery time after the gym seems to take a bit longer and I am tired for several days after a push day.\n\nMy nipples? Rock hard. Like they could cut glass I think. My whole life they’ve been mostly soft/flat and not very sensitive, but now they get rubbed raw when I run and hurt when I’m putting a shirt on. It is CRAZY because I never knew that they could feel that way lol.\n\nBrain fog is also an issue I’m dealing with as I go into my last year of college. Usually I am ready to learn and have laser focus on my first week back, but not this year. It’s manageable but it’s definitely there.\n\nMy acne is about the same as it’s always been, since starting the pill. No noticeable changes, which is not what I thought would happen. But I am thankful that it hasn’t gone back to being worse!\n\nI’d like to hear what other symptoms you all have experienced if you’ve gone off the pill before, or if some of the things I’ve listed are common. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I’m so frustrated. I’ve been on bc pills for like 15 years. And it took almost 5 years to find what worked for me. My body seems to be very sensitive to meds and hormones so I tended to get a ton of side effects. Finally I found loryna and it worked! No significant side effects. Maybe an occasional break through bleed but nothing else. Before bc pills I had cramps so bad I’d passed out once and bleeding that was crazy. After bc I still have heavy periods but not insane. And cramps that are much more manageable so i really need it.\n\nThen my lovely health insurance company decided that they no longer covered it. So I switched to Yaz. Should be the same right? Nope! Yaz unfortunately gives me major migraines during my periods. It sucks. I’m gonna say screw it and try Nexplanon. Maybe it’ll work maybe it’ll suck but that suckers in for three years if it does work and so insurance can’t rip that away from me.\n\nSuck it American health insurance.",

I've heard others say that combo pills are more forgiving than the minipill, and you can really take it within the same 3-ish hour window daily.

When I came off of bc it was because it was giving me neurological symptoms such as epilepsy so I'm not a normal case, but I had breakthrough bleeding a bit before. Anyway, I had a heavier period but it actually wasn't as heavy as beforehand and I had less pain, though I went on bc in the first place to eliminate these things, it was only expected to be stopped whilst I was taking bc. Then within 6 months everything went back to normal and regulated itself. It might be irregular or you might have a long period to begin with, but I would suggest trying, seeing which things you can tolerate more (side affects of bc or period symptoms) and giving it a few months before making a decision. Remember it may take a bit for your hair too, and age I think can thin your hair a little as well. I think your partner probably didn't expect you to ask hence the reaction and he's obviously never considered it before but it does seem like an overreaction, but you have every right to be free of hormones, especially given what you've stated above. Also, you don't have to bear the burden of bc alone as there are other options like condoms etc. I would hold off on the snip only because vasagel looks like it'll be approved next year and the studies I've read are pretty promising, and it's the same thing but completely reversible. 😊",

    "selftext": "I’ve never used Reddit before but made this account to ask for advice as I currently feel like I am in crisis and don’t know what else to do. Im a 19 year old girl and met my boyfriend last year, I immediately fell in love, and I have never felt so happy in a relationship. He made me realise what it feels like to be in love, and I would never want to be with anyone else. I started taking birth control (Rigevidon pill) around 7 months ago, and never had any issues with using it as it made my severe period cramps go away and made my periods regular, which they never were before. However, around 2 or 3 weeks ago I started to develop quite severe acne, which I found strange as I have never had any skin problems before. Around the same time, I randomly began questioning how I felt around my boyfriend. I would sit with him and think “do I feel happy right now?” “How do I feel when I look at him?” And for the first time in the relationship I didn’t feel the butterflies or the happiness, and that sparked anxiety. This last week has felt like absolute hell, I suddenly feel emotionally disconnected from him, and every time I look at him or think about him I feel extreme anxiety and dread, like something is seriously wrong. I have found myself mourning the relationship as if we had already broken up for absolutely no reason whatsoever, as nothing has changed, he is perfect and so caring which makes this whole thing so much worse as I feel extremely guilty for feeling these things. My anxiety has gotten so bad that I have considered calling a crisis hotline or something but I don’t know who to speak to, or even just breaking up with him to end the pain, which is the last thing I want to do, and if you had told me even 3 weeks ago that I would be feeling like this I would have been in complete disbelief. I do not know why I feel like this but I think that birth control might be playing a role. Granted I am 7 months in and never experienced side effects before this, but the sudden onset of these feelings alongside the random acne makes me think that maybe there has been a shift in hormones because of it? These feeling feel unnatural and wrong, and I feel so anxious and depressed but only in relation to my boyfriend which I can’t understand. I really need some advice, if anyone else has experiences this please let me know, I don’t know what to do anymore  ",

    "selftext": "I've had the Paraguard IUD for 8 years now..honestly, it might be expired and I'm taking it out next week. While it's been great to never have to worry about pregnancy, it's made my periods absolute hell. The bleeding is non-stop and heavy for the whole week straight, as opposed to the light & spotty periods I used to have before. I've always been in fear of leaking and it's to the point where I wouldn't want to risk going outside if I didn't have to. And now, for some reason, my periods have started coming every five or six weeks.\n\nI honestly don't know what life as a woman would be like without the IUD -- maybe my depression will go away, maybe less hair will fall out, maybe I could orgasm easier, but my periods will definitely be an easier time to get through. So I finally decided I don't want it replaced immediately. I want to see how the next couple of months go before having something jammed into my body (not to mention, my cervix is really high and the procedure to get it inserted was hell for me too).\n\nPlus, with all the news of pads and tampons being toxic to our bodies in the recent years, I'm a little nervous about what IUDs could be doing to our bodies.. like not enough time has passed for us to truly understand the implications they could have on women. I'm becoming a little skeptical, so I want to transition to a birth control system that needs less commitment. Not interested in depo or getting anything else inserted into my body for now.\n\nI used to take the pill when I was 16, but had to stop because the nicotine in my system caused me to start developing a blood clot in my leg. I'm still working on quitting smoking now (only five days clean lol), but is there any recommendations for pills that won't give me the worst side effects? (i.e. blood clotting, mood swings, severe acne, bloating, etc) \n\nWhat is your experience with the pill that has worked best for you?",

    "selftext": "I (F19) have been on the pill since i was about 12 years old. It was originally prescribed to combat my very heavy periods and for that purpose I believe it worked. However, as i’ve gotten older I realised I have next to no sex drive and even when I do try to engage in sexual activity it is very hard for me to reach orgasm (TMI I know!) This has become an issue now that i’m with a partner who obviously wants to engage with me that way and wants me to enjoy it as much as they do. \n\nAnyway, I decided to swap my method of contraception recently and decided the hormonal coil would be the best fit for me, since the hormones mean I won’t suffer any withdrawals symptoms from coming off the pill ( I was super scared of gaining weight or having changes like that since I have been on the pill for so long.) \n\nMy question is will changing to the hormonal coil impact my sex drive? I know it only contains the progesterone hormone and not the oestrogen that the pill has so will that make any difference? \n\nThanks for reading and any advice or your experiences would be appreciated!",

    "title": "Debating if I should quit the pill",
    "selftext": "I have never really posted on reddit asking for advice before, but here it goes. For context, I am a 26-year-old female. I have been on a variety of different oral contraceptives pills before, but just last year I had to switch over to a progesterone-only pill (Jencycla) due to my aura migraines. As of today, I have been taking Jencycla for about a year, and I fear that the pill has been making my anxiety way worse than what it actually is. I have struggled with anxiety since I was about 19, mostly centred around health anxiety, but it has never been this hard to manage. I was actually able to get to a point a few years ago where I could completely regulate myself and prevent panic attacks from happening, but they seem to be so far out of my control over this past year. Over this past week, I have had a panic attack almost daily, whether it be about my health, or bodily symptoms that I do not even think really exist; and it is quickly turning into my own personal hell. Not only this, but as someone who is (unwillingly) very in tune with her own body, I have noticed that ever since I started this pill, I seem to experience vertigo head-rush-like symptoms from time to time -- enough so that it sends me into a panic sometimes. I have never been one to faint or get dizzy, but ever since I started this pill I have noticed this symptom GREATLY. I know what you are probably thinking, \"oh its been a year and you have never let your doctor know?\" I have a few reasons as to why I haven't switched pills or quit all together. \n\n1. I have struggled with anxiety for so long that it is almost a part of my every day life. In some way, it has been more comfortable to deal with it, but I am slowly realizing that I need some sort of relief, and I need to make a change ASAP. \n\n2. I had to have an abortion back in 2023 after accidentally getting pregnant, and it was singlehandedly one of the most traumatizing things I have ever gone through, and I never want to do it again. So a huge part of me is almost forcing myself to suffer through these symptoms so I never have to do it again. \n\n3. I am pretty much at the point where I would not like to switch birth controls because I think I would rather quit all together. Especially after reading how it affects women. \n\nI am not really open to anxiety medication because I would rather make some lifestyle changes first, so this week I think I am going to try quitting coffee to see how that affects me. Next would be to probably quit the pill, but I am curious to hear some thoughts and opinions about it. Have you ever had this reaction on a progesterone-only pill? Do you think it would be worth it to quit? Is cycle tracking an effective contraceptive method? \n\nI would really love to hear from you guys, and it would comfort be greatly to know that I am not the only one going through this.\n\nThanks 🩷",

I'm tired of this tug of war! \n\nI tried to go through Planned Parenthood but they were charging $240 per year, then I decided to go with Amazon because it's a $29 virtual visit for a 3 month supply plus 3 more refills. My pill has always been free.\n\nI'm in California not on medi-cal. Is this the cheapest thing I can do to obtain the pill or is there a better way I have not tried? I can't be going through this every few months it's insane that it's suddenly been so hard to get something I've been on for over a decade.",

You pay for an online appointment (usually just message with them) with a doctor through Good RX and they prescribe the birth control pill that's right for you (you select the pharmacy you want and the prescription goes straight to that pharmacy from Good RX), and that prescription usually lasts for at least a year, then you have to set up another online appointment, but they're cheap (I think no more than $20).",

For some context, I am nearly 17 years old and started my period at 11, and am currently on an anti-anxiety medication (sertraline). I’m also worried about approaching a doctor about this because I’ve had bad experiences in the past. periods used to be so bad when I was younger and everytime me or my parents tried to go to a doctor, they would brush me off and tell me it was normal in girls my age (spoiler alert, it wasn’t normal, I had fucking cysts), so I’m worried that if I try to bring this up with a doctor I’ll be brushed off again or told to wait a few more years. My dad’s on board with the idea and so am I, I just don’t know how to go about it.",

It felt like a traditional cycle where I could feel each phase; it just felt very rushed. I understand it’s only been one cycle, but I’m wondering if anyone has had experience with this.

    "title": "Hormonal imbalance after coming off the pill",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m hoping someone out there might have the answers I’m looking for, or has maybe shared a similar experience.\n\nSo I’m 25 years old and I came off the pill (Yasmin) in January 2025 after almost 7.5 years on it and since then, I’ve had 7 cycles and they still haven’t returned to a regular pattern. I’ve been tracking my cycles closely using BBT and ovulation tests, and whilst my luteal phase has consistently been 12 days, my follicular phase has so far been very variable in length.\n\nMy ovulation days so far have been: 21, 26, 37, 18, 26, 33 (took the morning after pill this cycle) & 29.\n\nI had extensive blood tests done in August 2025 on cycle day 10. My FSH, LH & prolactin were normal, but my oestradiol was 112 pmol/L which is low for cycle day 10. My testosterone was right in the upper range of normal, and my free androgens were middle of the range. My doctor wasn’t concerned about PCOS, and I’ve no symptoms of PCOS, apart from irregular ovulation.\n\nIron, B12, folate, thyroid, liver, cholesterol etc. were all fine. However, red blood cells and white blood cells were right near the lower end of normal.\n\nBased on my research, I think the problem is that my body is sending the right signals to my ovaries (FSH), but my ovaries are being slow to respond in producing estrogen, which is why I’m then ovulating late. My doctor isn’t concerned and just said that for some women, it can take up to 18 months for their cycles to fully stabilise after coming off the pill.\n\nThe problem I’m having is that for my whole luteal phase, I feel like crap. As soon as I ovulate, I maybe have a couple more good days and then I start feeling really crappy until my period. I get insomnia and when I do fall asleep I don’t get much deep sleep, I’ve no energy, serious brain fog, no motivation, I feel sensitive and irritable, I can’t stop eating carbs and my skin’s breaking out. By the end of my luteal phase, I feel like I can’t function normally.\n\nAfter googling it, I think what might be happening is that my estrogen is staying low for my whole cycle. So when my body begins producing progesterone after ovulating, I don’t have enough estrogen to balance it out, which then causes all of those horrible symptoms throughout my luteal phase.\n\nAlso, since I came off the pill my periods have been much lighter than they were on the pill, which suggests to me that my womb lining isn’t thickening enough. Which supports my theory that I’m not producing enough estrogen - because estrogen is responsible for thickening the womb lining.\n\nHas anyone else been through this and when did your cycles stabilise? Does anyone have any tips for encouraging my body to produce more estrogen? Or if you disagree that the problem is sluggish estrogen production, please let me know what else you think could be going on.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that when I went on the pill, I had only got my first period 2.5 years before, and my cycles never became regular in that time. However, I remember my periods being a lot heavier than they are now.\n\nThanks in advance!!",

I had the same fears but actually feel like myself almost all of the time now :)\n\nI tried a few pill variations including low estrogen ones, and some were ok and some I felt a little worse. I’ve been on the nuvaring for four years now and it’s been the best experience ever. It’s a constant release of hormones, and I’ve found that it works a lot better for me because there’s no “ups and downs” (hormone dump when you take the pill, then levels decrease until your next dose). I feel so stable but still have energy and the desire to do things.\n\nIn the past year or so I’ve also started taking a small dose of sertraline daily, and it’s helped a lot too. I honestly don’t know how I made it this far before I figured out what works for me, because I can’t believe how great I feel all the time now. The “trial and error” experience of birth control is super frustrating and I really empathize with how you’re feeling right now. The nice thing about the pill/ring/patch methods is that you can stop immediately if you start feeling worse. I’d suggest keeping a mood diary to keep track of any changes you feel if you start a new method. However, also keep in mind that it usually takes about three months for your body to “get used” to new hormones, so try to stick it out for that time period unless you feel really terrible.\n\nSorry this is so long but your post reminds me a lot of my situation in my early twenties!

    "selftext": "All I'm sharing is anecdotal and based on my own experience.\n\nI've been struggling with low lows and high highs for years, I thought I might be bipolar. On a schedule, I'd have at least one breakdown a month. I would be eaten alive at night by horrible thoughts and impulses to hurt myself and run away. I'd feel unlovable and worthless yet a few days later I'd feel like I could take over the world with never ending motivation and creativity. I thought I might be bipolar, turns out it was just PMDD but the pill was hiding this connection from me.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nI've been taking the mini pill for 6 years. It stopped my periods almost right away which was really nice, but about a year ago I began having pain flares. Possibly ovarian cysts. Hormonal acne also came back with a horrible vengeance like I haven't had since I was a teenager. Something was clearly going wrong with my body so I began looking into ways to balance my hormones.\n\nAs a result of my efforts to balance my hormones, the pain flares stopped and I surprisingly began getting my period again. And now it's on a schedule! Finally I connected the dots, it's like a light switch went on in my brain.\n\nThe pill was suppressing my periods, but I was still having hormonal fluctuations. Not having the visual sign of a period made me think I was spiralling frequently for no reason. Yet in the absence of a period my hormones still followed a normal cycle, I just wasn't seeing it.\n\nI'm still on the mini pill but this time I'm hoping not to lose my period again 🙏 It's been so helpful to know my depressive episodes are normal and will end soon. I even look forward to my period now because I can take a sick day and recover mentally lol",

    "selftext": "I am in my thirties. was on the mini pill for 10 years which masked my PMDD symptoms (but also my capacity for joy).  During this time I was diagnosed with hashimotos (low thyroid). Last year I also got diagnosed with ADHD. However I'm realising that my ADHD symptoms are very particular to certain times of the month. This subreddit has been really instrumental in helping me make what should be such an obvious link. \n\nI came off the mini pill 6 months ago but then had to have an emergency copper coil fitted. Ever since my moods and body have felt incredibly uneven. For 10 days I feel incredible. Euphoric, at times. Something I never experienced on the pill. I feel alive. Then it shifts into such stultifying fragility. I miss days at work because it feels as if im getting flu (I don't). I cry at work - over nothing. \n\nI'm wondering whether to get the coil out and to go back on the pill, or whether to take a low dose of fluoxetine during luteal. The thing is, those 10 days of euphoria, libido and strength are hard to let go off. It almost makes the rest worth it - almost. But I feel like an addict in my own body. \n\nCan anyone offer any insight into managing with fluoxetine (prozac) during luteal? \n\n",

    "selftext": "Note, this is a repost, but just because I used the wrong brand name of the medication in the title and I can't edit the title, and I didn't want the incorrect information to stay up so I deleted my prior post.\n\n\nSharing this story so that other people who take this med and might search for information on PMDD can be informed. I want to state that both the med and oral BC are just fine and I'm not warning people away from either! It's just important to know how much they interact.\n\n\nI have had a partial hysterectomy (my ovaries remain but my uterus is gone), and had forgotten how bad my PMDD was in the decade I had been using a Mirena. Long story short I started an oral BC, skipping placebo weeks, to manage my PMDD. The pharmacist warned me that one med I'm on, Trileptal (oxcarbazepine), can make birth control ineffective, but I just said I'm taking it for hormone management not contraception so I wasn't worried. In retrospect this was kinda ridiculous of me - if the med affects the hormones in a way that means they no longer prevent pregnancy, that also means it won't change my cycle. Well, that's what happened. \n\n\nMy PMDD actually got far worse, but due to some other med changes I didn't realize that's what happened for a year, and it really only came up as I was also figuring out I have migraines and should stop the pill for that reason.\n\n\nWhen I did research into other options with my gynecologist, I found out that the medication can interfere with hormonal birth control even when it's through the shot (Depo) or implants (like Implanon or Nexplanon). IUDs seem to be fine. I'm not a doctor but from this I surmise that the local hormones in an IUD can do their job, but Trileptal can interfere when the hormones have to go through the bloodstream.\n\n\nAfter I came off the BC, I'm doing a lot better about 3 months later, and my symptoms aren't nearly as severe. I'm still looking into other options and hoping I can stay on the Trileptal while solving the PMDD because it's been extremely helpful for me.\n\n\nBest of luck to all of you out there!",

    "selftext": "I can't take estrogen-based pills because of another medication I'm on (Trileptal), and I'm not open to an IUD, shot, copper ring, etc. Unfortunately, my PMDD does not responded to SSRIs (I've been on Zoloft, prozac, lexapro, and more).\n\nI finally found something that I felt comfortable with tying: Slynd, a relatively new birth control that has actually been found effective for many people with PMDD. It just hasn't been clinically studied, yet.\n\nMy gyno responded with the screenshot above after I reached out to request a prescription.\n\nWhy is she not willing to let me try something that MIGHT help especially when she was okay throwing Estrogen-based birth controls at me despite them interacting with my other medication (which I told her they did)?\n\nWhy was she okay suggesting SSRIs (even after I explained they didn't work) which have actual, proven clinical studies that show an increase in mood disturbances and SI in many people?\n\nWhy is she okay throwing these two options at me, but not something that might actually help with little risk??\n\nAnyway, she shut the thread so I couldn't respond or advocate for myself. I'm absolutely gutted.\n\nI don't feel that this was an appropriate response - it's dismissive and minimizing -, but I'm also in the midst of luteal and am doing my best to feel normal right now.\n\nI'm already taking tons of supplements: magnesium, omega 3 fish oil, and vitamin b and other stuff - but I'm still just absolutely beat down by PMDD every month. I'm just so exhausted.\n\nI went to my gyno because my psychiatrist didn't feel comfortable prescribing me birth control as he doesn't know enough about it, but he confirmed that Slynd would be a good starting point and that it didn't interact with my medication.\n\nHe told me to continue to use valium whenever I have panic attacks (which only occur during ovulation and luteal), but I don't want to overuse it because I don't like its affects on the mind and body.\n\nIn all honesty, I feel like I never have a good experience with gynos. I've only ever been dismissed and side-eyed by them when I try to get help with my PMDD.\n\nI've literally been told \"well, SSRIs are the main method for helping with PMDD, so you're just going to have to deal with it.\" I've also been told that I just need to get over it or calm down. How? :( I'm trying. I want help!\n\nI've done 9 years of CBT and talk therapy. I'm well-versed in all grounding techniques and should probably receive a certificate of excellence for my efforts. But I can't control the spiral when it comes quicker than a damn freight train being driven by an over-caffeinated raccoon.\n\nIf I could magically control my body's sensitivity to hormones, I would! Trust me. I would.\n\nUgh!\n\nThank you all for reading my vent. I feel a bit better getting it all out there.\n\nIs there another way I could get help? Am I overreacting? Should I talk to my GP about this? Who should I go to for help? No one is willing to listen to me!",

    "title": "I had a hysterectomy and it worked",
    "selftext": "Bear with me, English isnt my first language.\n\nI had my subtotal hysterectomy (no more uterus and ovaries, still have my cervix) last Halloween, at 31 years old. It worked.\n\nI started my period at 9. I had terrible pains since. Sometimes having ovarian cysts, hemorrhagic periods and everything nice. I started having mental health issues at the same time. When I was 12, I asked my doctor to get a hysterectomy for the first time and he laughed, he told me to come back when I'll be 18 and prescribed me birth control. \n At 18 I was still suffering and my mental health was at its worst. I asked again for the surgery as the pill, the ring, and the implants didn't help. I ended up with an IUD. Tw for medical trauma: >! It was inserted with a scalpel and no medication. The second one I had 5 years later too. !< Even though I knew for sure I never wanted kids at 5yo, what if I changed my mind? \n I continued asking multiple doctors, multiple gyno every years for the surgery. Always being told something along the lines of \"You are too young, you will change your mind, what if husband wants kids\". The last gyno I saw before the one that gave me the surgery even basically said, and I wish I was joking: \"What if you divorced *your vasectomized husband with whom you have been for almost a decade* husband and the next one wants kids?\" Before making me go through chemical menopause with lupron injections for over a year. \n I started having shorter and shorter cycles, still struggling but with a 11 days cycle instead of 28. So I was on my period 7/11 days with debilitating pains, overlapping with pmdd 10/11 days. Obviously I wasn't happy with the medication and asked for an hysterectomy, again. That's when she passed me to her colleague. That one didn't even believed me. She said it was scientifically impossible for me to still have any kind of cycle on lupron. She made me so uncomfortable so many times but she said yes for the surgery so I tried my best to endure. She said she was doing it but that since I was observing a cycle in my mental health, it was probably not even gonna help with that. \n\nBut it did. \nAt 24 I was finally diagnosed PMDD and started journaling to help with the depression, anxiety, PTSD and *wrong* bipolar diagnosis I was also dealing with. So I can literally see how drastically it changed my life. ***\n\nSo here I am, at 32 years old, with no more depression, almost no anxiety, able to deal with my traumas and no sign whatsoever of bipolar. Pretty much never fighting with my husband, feeling good for the first time since I was 9 and as rational and peacefull as my autistic self can be. I learned who I am and how much my PMDD wasn't me. \n\nBut I am grieving and pissed about how my life would've been if I was listened from the start. Would I have been in the toxic relationship that left me disabled? Would I have lost so many friendships? Would I have discovered before 27yo that I was autistic? And avoid life altering burnout? Would I be dealing with debilitating chronic pains and autoimmune issues today? Would my 20s have been as poor, painful and scary as it was? \n\nSo yeah, sorry for rambling, I think I really needed to get this out. But know that if you feel like having your ovaries removed is the way, I wish for it to be as life changing for you as it was for me. And I hope all of you will live to see that there's actually a light at the end where you get to meet the real you. And that you isn't as bad as your PMDD tell you you are. \n\n*** Images show mood journal entries from before (green), after (red) and the day of my surgery (purple arrow); My mental health changed the exact day and my recovery was easier because I felt so much better, incredible.

I came off the contraception pill 8th May and had a withdrawal bleed, I then came on my non pill period yesterday, pmdd has been present but not as horrifically as I remember it when I was off the pill last year, but I thought I’d go doctors to get prescribed antidepressants incase next month it’s worse after this proper non pill period ( looks like I can’t go on them due to being on Amfexa adhd meds ) but I have other ways that I am trying to deal with my pmdd too so I’m trying not to stress too much about that but anyway the point is… \n\n… I told him I have pmdd, he said sorry as in pms? I said no, it’s not pms and I had to educate him on exactly what pmdd is :( I could see he felt bad and I’m not mad at him, he was soo nice honestly but why on earth are GP’s not somehow all being educated on this?? It can literally make many of us want to d!e every month. Doctors need to be made aware of pmdd. It’s just awful. I feel like I want to make the whole world aware of pmdd. \n\nThe thought of women suffering pmdd without knowing what it is :( and then they go to gp and the gp pies them off with “ it’s just pms “ LIKE PLEASE it stresses me out so much I can’t stand the thought of women suffering with this without any knowledge of what’s going on. WHY is there not a massive notification on the doctors systems saying “ PMDD AWARENESS, ITS SYMPTOMS YOU MUST BE AWARE OF ARE…  “ COME ON !!!!!!! I can’t believe I had to tell my doctor what pmdd was today.. again no hate to him he seemed keen to be educated but fuck sake come the fuck on something has to change ",

    "title": "Why didn't I try this sooner?",
    "selftext": "The other day I made a post about being upset with my husband when I returned from a 5 day trip to visit a friend. The house was messy, nothing crazy, but I had high expectations that it'd be spotless when I came home. Clutter/mess is my biggest PMDD trigger, stemming from childhood trauma.\n\nTwo days after this incident, I started intermittent Prozac at 10mg. Within an hour, I felt level and like my normal self. I was able to see my husband's situation - he started a new job while I was away, and meeting new people and getting to learn the lay of the land was overwhelming for him and he's never great about cleaning anyways. The house was not as bad as I made it out to be. I immediately forgave him and have been feeling good for the past 3 days.\n\nI am having some internal tremor sort of feelings, but I can't directly attribute that as a Prozac side effect just yet. I took a steroid nasal spray for two years and have been trying to \"recover\" for about a year. Apparently it can mess with your HPA axis and take 1-2 years to reset. (Look it up!) So sometimes I do have weeks where I feel kind of shaky and don't sleep well. If it stops when I stop the Prozac when I get my period, I'll have to mention that to my doctor to see if that's a concern or worth switching pills or doing full-time vs intermittent.\n\nI have tried everything that I can \"naturally.\" I've always had a good diet, and had been mostly vegetarian with occasional fish for about 5 years (made the PMDD much worse) before switching back to omnivore about a year ago. I exercise, and have tried low-impact options like walking and yoga as well as weight lifting (up to 15 lb dumbbells). I've tried supplements like Vitex, ashwagandha, evening primrose oil, probiotics, mushrooms (reishi, chaga, etc), turmeric, calcium, zinc, vitamin D and magnesium. I've given up caffeine and alcohol. I spent time in prayer and meditation.\n\nFinally, I started doing some research on SSRIs, since that is the recommended treatment option. I was nervous about side effects including long term effects, as I had heard that could increase risk of dementia later in life. I didn't want to deal with weight gain or nausea, or sexual side effects since I already have a really low drive. But then I bit the bullet. I accepted that I do have a mental health condition. **It's not just me not trying hard enough.** My brain doesn't function the way it should. Medication helps it work correctly. If I had any other mental health condition, I'd be taking meds. Why was this so hard to accept?\n\nGranted, I'm three days in. Things could change tomorrow or next month. I'm so optimistic though and so glad I tried it. I hope things continue to improve.",

Also, your brain is normal for you, we just live in a culture that expects all brains to behave according to a specific brain chemistry that creates good capitalist worker bees.\n\nUltimately, whatever makes your life easier and helps you feel like yourself is right. For some, that's the all-natural route, for others that's SSRIs. Chronic stress is bad for the body, so whatever lowers your stress from the PMDD symptoms is helping you in the long term. And it's just another tool in your toolbox!\n\nI tried the all natural route too, then after a particularly dark luteal phase I decided to try wellbutrin (for reference I also have ADHD, so the mild stimulant effects have helped my ADHD symptoms as well). I take it every day and it has helped me SO MUCH. I am no longer suicidal for a full week of every month, the intrusive thoughts are manageable, and I don't have to isolate myself from my loved ones for fear of emotionally hurting them. It also took the edge off my anxiety outside my luteal phase, which has been life changing.\n\nI do still have thoughts of shame around being dependent on a medication to function, but when I look at how much happier and stable I am now, it's easy to shrug off. At a certain point, the benefits outweigh the stigma.",

Holy shit I feel like I'm 10 years younger! I  have dropped 5 pounds,  my chronic eczema is gone,  my cystic acne is gone,  my eye bags are fading, and my heavy periods are such minor bleeding and cramps compared to my baseline ( heavy, debilitating periods) , even my boobs look like I got a little lift.\n\nAs for the mental symptoms, I'm a woman living with depression and when I found and antidepressant that worked, I resigned myself to the fact that I only get 2 somewhat happy stable weeks a month and it's miles better than 0.\n\nYaz has given me those missing 2 weeks and then some.  I'm so fucking stable yall and I have 3 pills left till my period. I am so focused at my job, my self-esteem is good,   and for the first time in my lifetime, I'm not manic around food and stress eating.  I can just enjoy food for what it is and not have it on my mind 24/7. It's normally my coping mechanism for surviving the rough weeks. I've been going through some rough personal personal challenges lately, and while I've had some crying fits about them( justifiably so),  I have been able to compartmentalize vs. catastrophize. It's wild to me that I have been feeling better during a rough patch than I normally do through \"good\" times. I don't want to KMS the 2 weeks before my period. I actually want to be here. 😭\n\n\nThe only side effects I've noticed are that my libido has unfortunately dropped and my... gums are sensitive when they normally aren't? I can try to work around this. \n\nDon't want to jinx it, but ladies, this could save you.",

    "title": "Realized I’ve always had PMDD",
    "selftext": "Yesterday, I found a journal entry from when I was 13 years old. I wrote “my period is making me really angry and sad all the time. also i’m getting it really frequently and heavy. it’s been lasting like 9 days.”  This shocked me as I didn’t remember whether I had always had PMDD or not. I remembered heavy painful periods but not the mood shifts, probably because a) trauma and b) I was constantly told I was dramatic, and then later diagnosed with anxiety and depression (and then even later CPTSD) so I just assumed all my mental health issues stemmed from that. But my SI and SH both started when I was 13. I got on the pill around 15 due to the heavy periods and it made them lighter and less painful, but I think it just put me in a permanent state of having low to medium-level PMDD symptoms and depression. I was on that for 10 years before coming off and when I did, the PMDD became more cyclical which made me do research and realize I had it. As in, I started having good weeks and really bad weeks rather than just one big mix of shit. But the fact that I’ve always had it just makes so much sense. Especially because my home life was in absolute turmoil and chaos when my menstruation started, I’m wondering if that could be part of the cause? Interested to hear other people’s experiences. \n\nIt makes me sad that it took 15 years of suffering to figure this out, and there’s probably other girls who have gone through or currently going through the same. But I’m glad PMDD is becoming more known as I had never even heard about it until a few years ago. ",

I don’t have journal entries, but I remember some baffling blow-ups and mood states that didn’t actually seem situationally linked. It definitely worsened things for me and caused worse mental health on top of factors already contributing to that. I was undiagnosed for a number of things, not just PMDD, but also Autism, ADHD, and now suspected PCOS (still under assessment). The PCOS makes sense for a lot, and may have even been delaying how often PMDD showed up until I finally got on a birth control around 26, as my periods tended to be skipped and didn’t show up every month before that. In general all this definitely all mashed up into a very confusing stew once actual depression and anxiety started to crop up around 5th grade for me. I can point that to being pre-period, but the intensity of it didn’t ramp up for me until post-menstruation started for me. I also have trauma from my upbringing, and was also made out to be the “melodramatic” one not to be taken seriously. Also wound up with CPTSD due to many factors. That’s a devastating life to go through, and I’m sorry you have gone through this stuff too, OP.\n\nI’m grateful to have figured PMDD out, but like you I find myself sad over it. Partly for myself going through all this, but mostly for other girls and women going through these things with no idea. My biggest thing now is to just be open with the conditions I’ve now been diagnosed with. I don’t care if it’s “cringe” or “embarrassing” to say that kind of stuff anymore, and I don’t aim to share so many exposing details I’ll trigger that reaction in someone reasonably; I just hope that by me talking about PMDD, Autism, CPTSD/PTSD, and ADHD that I can make any sort of difference for even one person.",

I only realized it was PMDD at around 23 and only found a doctor willing to take it seriously at 27. I’m now 31 and have a solution. I went through every type of birth control you can, multiple SSRIs, and had my hormones checked about 100 times. Finally I saw a nurse practitioner who said my progesterone was lower than it should be and prescribed bio identical progesterone.\n\nIt worked right away. I haven’t been ovulating regularly on it so it wouldn’t work if I was trying to get pregnant, but I am done with babies anyway. I will say it really impacted my sex drive at first but now it has come back after 3 months.\n\nI missed my dose 1 singular night when my period was close and I was a mess. Like I had a full breakdown because I didn’t know where the apples were in the grocery store. \n\nMy husband is so frustrated that I had to go through 13 years of hell to end up just having to take a couple pills at night. He was so worried about me especially now that we have kids because I was getting really bad suicidal thoughts. And poof now I’m just normal all the time.\n\nIt also solved my chronic bloat, fatigue, migraines, sleep issues, and brain fog. I also used to breakout anytime I had dairy and now I can have it again. Never thought that was related to hormones.\n\nI hope this can help someone else!

I’m going to try everything I can to give you guys every bit of info to try and help me even a tad. \n\nI feel so uncomfortable every damn day. I am on Junel 1/20 continuously. I’ve been for let’s say 3-4 years now. I was diagnosed with PMDD at 18 years old and now am 30. I’ve been on different pills but they “stopped working” etc. I don’t know if one “can grow out of PMDD” either. \n\nI’m on it 12 weeks on, one week off. Lately, I only last 9 weeks because my body nudges me in ways to take the break then. Three weeks ago, I was off it, my normal week break. I felt… nice. It wasn’t perfect, but, I wanted to keep feeling that way. I get back on after Day 7, extreme anxiety ever since. Exacerbated mental health symptoms etc. You can tell, it is from the pill. \n\nA few days ago, I was two hours late taking my Junel, and my body has been crampy ever since, like it thinks I’m doing the week off again.\n\nPoint of this TedTalk is: Two weeks ago I had a telehealth with my current OB/GYN, and the whole practice has made me lost trust. She gave me two options:\n\n1. Take Yasmin continuously instead being I’m 30 now and hormones change etc.\n2. Come off the pill cold turkey for 1-3 months to see how I feel.\n\nI didn’t decide. This is a huge decision as you can see, like my livelihood is on the line. Today, after three calls and being told I would get a call back with guidance by the end of the day, a nurse was extremely dismissive of me on the phone, like I was a pity call, at 5:02 PM. I was told the doctor said do the quit cold turkey, with no backing as to why that would be the best option for me.\n\nI have an appointment with another doctor in that practice for… end of October. So basically, I’m still taking the Junel and suffering daily. Tried calling other practices, booked until January.\n\nIf anyone could possibly offer any insight about what I should do, I can’t express how grateful I would be, after this awful degrading experience. All I want to do is feel as close to myself as I can and get help. \n",

I was so worried she wouldn't even know what PMDD is. But she totally did know and has helped many women with it. She completely understands hormones and cycles. She actually complimented me on how knowledgeable I am too, compared to most doctors who side-eye you for knowing things about your own body. \n\nI left with a prescription for an antihistamine that might also help my insomnia and she suggested a progesterone supplement which I ordered right away. She explained how taking birth control pills for a long time (I took it for 10 years) causes our body to make less naturally, and she's seen a lot of women with hormone issues feel way better with more progesterone. She also wants me to get thyroid labs done again because mine were too high even though my doctor had said it was within normal range. I was impressed by that because after my results months ago, I read all about how women's thyroid levels should be much lower that most doctors think is okay.\n\nI barely had to bring any of this up with her, just told her my experience and she knew what to do. Such a relief to have someone who actually knows! It feels surreal because I had my hopes low and didn't expect to actually get help.\n\nEdit: this was at a local business that focuses on mental health, it's the same place I go to therapy. I chose it because I hoped that practitioners here have more experience with mental health and was right! I don't know how common this type of business is but maybe see if you have something like this locally.",

    "title": "For the Newly Diagnosed - General List of Things I Have Found to Be Helpful To Manage This Condition",
    "selftext": "This list is primarily for those who have been recently diagnosed. I've been testing all the meds, supplements, and coping mechanisms for 10+ years and have learned quite a bit. \n\n1. Birth Control - I take progesterone only BC everyday. I do not take the sugar pills. Doing this prevents the extreme drop in progesterone that triggers my worst symptoms. My understanding is that not everyone has a sesntivity to progesterone changes, and it may even make symptoms worse so you may need to play with the kind of BC to see what works for you. Trial and error unfortunately.\n\n2. Tracking My Cycle - I used the Belle app. Because I take BC everyday, I do not get a period. However, because I track my symptoms throughout my entire cycle, I have been able to identify when each phase of my cycle occurs based on symptom severity. Tracking is KEY to managing this condition. I cannot stress this enough. I share my logs with my partner so he knows exactly what to expect and when my luteal phase is starting. \n\n3. Tracking my emotions - Alongside the Belle app I use another app called \"How we feel.\" It has helped me get better at identifying my emotions in real time, and noticing certain patterns that arise. The app also has an AI chatbot that acts like an affirming therapist. When I am raging, I talk to the AI bot instead of unloading on the real people in my life. This have saved my relationship in many ways. \n\n4. SSRIs - I take sertraline. It helps reduce how \"low\" my depressive symptoms go. Different SSRIs work better for different people. Some people find tricyclic anti depressants are more helpful for PMDD...like BC you may need to play with what is best for your body. I increase my does by 25 mg during luteal which helps keep me emotionally balanced.\n\n5. Mood Stabilizer - I take lamotrigine for off label use as a mood stabilizer, which has significantly helped reduce the intensity of my highs (heightened negative emotions). Without lamotrigine my rages were at a tend with lamotrigine they average about a 6-7 depending on the day. Adding this to my protocol was a game changer. \n\n6. Vitex - This is a supplement that I have found works to keep my mood generally more stable. I wouldn't characterize Vitex as being the golden ticket, but it's fairly inexpensive and provides a modest improvement when used alongside my other medications, so it's worth it to me. \n\n7. Ice Packs/Cold Therapy - When I start to feel heightened emotions, I have an ice pack hat (used for migraines) that I put on. I usually pair it with an ice pack on my neck. Using cold therapy in this manner transitions the body into parasympathetic (calm) response. I'll lay in my bedroom with some zen music on for 20-30 minutes with the ice and it helps me move through the heightened amotions more quickly. It literally feels like by cooling down my body I am cooling down the emotion. I imagine things like taking a cold shower, ice baths, etc would awork in a similar manner. Doing this has been VERY helpful.\n\n8. Sleep - After tracking my symptoms, it became very apparent that when I lack sleep my symptoms become 10x worse. During luteal I stick to a strict bedtime, no exceptions. \n\n9. Accelerated Resolution Therapy - Also known as ART, this type of therapy has CHANGED MY LIFE. I've seen many posts about a potential link between a history of trauma and the severity of PMDD, and I believe there is a connection. ART is evidence based trauma therapy that is similar to EMDR but more effective for long term improvement. I saw significant improvement in my ability to manage difficult emotions after just one session. I am a natural skeptic and could not believe that after 10 years of therapy a single session could result in such a significant improvement. I cannot stop telling people about this because it has truly reduced the worst of my symptoms almost overnight.\n\nEdit: To clarify, each traumatic event takes 3-5 sessions to completely resolve. That said, with each session I felt a sigificant change. The repetition helps to fully cement the replacement memories long term. \n\n10. Support Groups - Both my partner and I attend PMDD support groups. Having a space to discuss the challenges of having this condition/having a partner with this condition has helped our relationship. Being able to share your experience and have others affirm the same experience makes it feel like you aren't alone. \n\nI would also recommend the following books:\n\nThe PMDD Phenomenon by Dr Diana Bell\n\nThe Cycle by Shalene Gupta\n\nThe Period Repair Manual by Lara Briden\n\n\n❤️",

I’ve always been extremely anxious and probably had PME that was masked by birth control (pills and IUD). \n\nLong story short, I got on sertraline 25mg a few months ago and it’s already changed my life significantly!!! I’m so surprised how well it works at such a low dose. Anxiety is basically GONE (insane for someone like me) for most of my cycle except my luteal phase where I genuinely turn into the most unhealed, triggered, neurotic, scared, anxious, angry person ever. I consistently fight with my boyfriend and I despise it so much but can’t stop it. I’ve never known what it was like to be so controlled by fucking hormones!! My thoughts are out of control. Don’t even get me started on my insane insomnia, appetite fluctuations, brain fog, general malaise and lack of energy. \n\nI’m planning on asking my psychiatrist about bumping up to 50mg during the second half of my cycle. Sticking with 25 rest if the time. Does anyone else use that combo? If not, what has worked for you. I’m accepting that I need to be medicated to be a human with any semblance of peace in her life. \n\nThank you\n\nA very tired girl ",

I think I had an actual period this week because I had the typical GI issues, intense mood swings, heavier bleeding, etc. I get alot of health anxiety around GI/bowel issues, and those issues come by more often when I'm menstruating so it's a lose-lose situation.\n\nBut where I was going with this is that my Psychiatrist did approve upping my dose of Zoloft. My CVS and MyChart say that it'll be upped to 100mg, but it kind of confuses me for the amount, so I need to message my Psychiatrist to ask if I'm reading it wrong as well as how to work my way up to the new dose.\n\nI'm sorry if this is all over the place, I'm very tired 😅 But Sertraline has worked really well for me, it just kind of seems like my cycle is immune to it (as frustrating as that is). Then again, it's a low dose vs PMDD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, heightened health anxiety, and probably a bunch of other things.\n\nI'm probably going to take my new dose all month long, I figured out through birth control that my body doesn't react to the back-and-forth fluctuations of things very well.\n\nI'm wishing you the best of luck! I do hope that the new dose helps with everything you're experiencing, I've had my own fair share of negative things surrounding periods and PMDD, and I know that it's never fun to deal with.",

    "selftext": "TW: dark thoughts. \n\n\nI don't know if I've put this in the right thread as I have so many issues - PMDD, OCD, a previous history of depression, chronic health issues and chronic fatigue which mean my normal coping mechanisms aren't possible and I'm very isolated.\n\nI'm in a PMDD episode now, though I've noticed that I now sometimes seem to get the mood swings after my period has started, rather than before. I've also started getting the pain 24 hours before the blood, so - dunno what is going on. \n\nAnyway. Due to the health stuff I've been sleeping badly and pretty nocturnally, and today I'm just in bed on my own (it's 5pm now). There is no prospect of anything on my horizon today to look forward to, and little to get me out of bed (I have had brunch). \n\nMy trigger this time - and this has been a trigger for me in the past - is plans with a friend being cancelled (he's done his back in so we didn't spend yesterday together as planned). I was glad of a bit more rest, but I'm taking the fact that he didn't suggest I come round to hang (neither of us is up for doing much other than sitting in bed and chilling, but I would have *loved* to do that in company) - I'm taking that as the worst rejection. I made it very clear I was happy to come round and help him out with cooking etc since he can't walk. I thought we were going to be planning a holiday together this weekend. I know he's feeling rough, and fully understand he can't do things (I can't really either, but that's because of fatigue and period pain) but I'm really struggling with knowing that he didn't even miss me. \n\nI've realised that my falling utterly apart when I get cancelled on and feel rejected and unwanted is a repeated trigger for bad PMDD episodes. I've had them all my life, but now that I'm sick and my life is very small (working from home and living alone; only got two real friends who've stuck around through my illness; no means to go out and meet now people) it's harder to deal with. \n\nI guess the thing I'm finding frustrating is that I am seeing a counsellor every week (she's not quite a fully qualified therapist - it's a service delivered through GP surgeries - but I get on with her and actually find her more flexible than others I've seen in the past). But... It's just not really improving anything. \n\nThe support is primarily for OCD, as that disrupts my sleep and therefore everything else, like my chronic fatigue, but we've had sessions where we've talked a bit about low mood or feeling anxious. \n\nBut fundamentally, being told to read my positives list, imagine a safe space or do guided meditation doesn't help me when my hormones have all the emotions rushing in and make me feel there's no point in being alive. \n\nI sometimes wonder if the fact that I'm in no danger of actually hurting myself just means... I'm just expected to get on with this ideation far too often.\n\nI've tried the pill and sertraline in the past and really didn't get on with them - my body really doesn't tolerate meds well unfortunately and my GP knows it's a frequent issue when trying any new meds. \n\nI don't want to pursue anything more nuclear as I want kids some day.\n\nI would love to get my general life into a happier place so the PMDD episodes hit me less hard, but I have no idea how, especially given my illness. \n\nI'd love to have the emotional regulation or resilience or self worth or whatever to ride these storms, but I don't know how. \n\nTalking, in the moment, when I'm in these episodes, helps, but I can't really put anything more on friends - I suspect I've already lost friends because I'm quite a downer (I'm very open and tend to overshare). But talking in a scheduled therapy session, when I might be ok on that day, or just in the middle of work, helps less.\n\nI've tried contacting Samaritans type services when mid episode sometimes but I just find it frustrating and feel the weight of having to deal with their reactions. \n\nSo my question is - what do you do when the therapy isn't working? \n\nAnd why do so many people bang on about how you should be in therapy, but noone talks about what happens when it doesn't help much? \n\nThanks for reading. If nothing else, writing this really helped me. ",

But my pure peace only lasts about a year before my symptoms start coming back; it’s happened twice. When it first happened I wasn’t sure what was happening, I thought the strength that worked was wearing off? So I got a new IUD with higher hormonal concentration and poof, symptoms gone again. But my doctor was doubtful, she said “if it stops working for your symptoms it may be time to try other options. The concentration of hormones released is the same for the duration of the IUD, so it wouldn’t wear off after time.” And it’s like,, I don’t know what to tell you but that’s evidently just not how it affects me? Because again, it’s been about a year after insertion and my symptoms are coming back. I’ve already tried other full-body birth control (the pill) and I got even worse. So like fuck no I don’t want to try other full-body treatment (implant, shot, patch), I don’t want to put myself through the gauntlet of misery again. I’d genuinely rather get my IUD reinserted once a month than experience PMDD symptoms. Idk it just bothered me that my doctor was kind of dismissive of something that works for me and gives me peace! A 15 minute insertion once a year is fucking NOTHING compared to a SINGLE DAY of symptoms. I don’t care if that’s “not how it works”, because that’s literally how it works for me. I don’t know how, or why, but it is, and I hope my doctor will hear me out and let me take the win I managed to find without pushing me to other shit to try. Thank you for listening🤍",

My hormones have always been very sensitive and being queer I have never needed to be on birth control but after suggestions from multiple doctors including ones in the family I decided to try it. \n\nI cannot take estrogen because of my risk of breast cancer so I have been on the progestin only contraceptive norethindrone aka the mini-pill and that is the KEY to this whole thing. Norethindrone doesn’t have a placebo week, so you take it daily and it keeps your hormones at a steady level instead of allowing that huge drop to happen which is usually when the PMDD symptoms would start to kick in. It sounds so simple, and it is- but I know it doesn’t work that easily for everyone because again- everyone is different! \n\nThis is not labeled as a cure for PMDD like YAZ but it has definitely helped me and many others get our lives back. \n\nI seriously feel like a whole new person and LIFE IS GOOD which feels absolutely crazy to say. Please feel free to ask me anything! \n\nAnyways, love y’all strangers please hang in there 🙏🏻",

    "title": "I'm going back to an IUD...",
    "selftext": "I really don't even know where to start with this post, but I guess I just generally need to get this off of my chest. Happy to hear supportive advice.\n\nI've had PMDD the majority of my life. I got my first period at 10 years old and looking back, it is so clear to me that I had PMDD from the very start. My mother did too (she's now gone through menopause) and she never got help nor did she help me. There's a lot more to unpack there, but, moving on...\n\nDespite being gaslit about the PMDD when I was a teenager, I was still prescribed Yaz. It didn't help and I probably didn't realize how much it wasn't helping. I was always told it was \"necessary\" to have a monthly period to \"clean everything out\" unless I was pregnant. I eventually started to get sick from Yaz and sicker from the generic. I moved on to other pills & the patch, and eventually gave up. Then, I got an IUD.\n\nI had the Mirena to start, which got embedded in my uterine lining. After a barbaric removal (I've been told that by multiple OBGYNs at this point), it was replaced with the Kyleena. I had some issues on the Kyleena, mostly I could suffer through some pretty low depression episodes. However, I was still able to work two jobs, see my friends, workout, lose weight, and had a sex drive. I also didn't have a period. A true godsend. \n\nAfter I took out my IUD, it became so apparent to me immediately how bad the PMDD was. While I was now able to swing upwards in my mood during my follicular phase, what followed in the luteal phase was terrifying. It still is. My OBGYN at the time told me the only treatment was to get pregnant as soon as possible and stay pregnant often. We are one and done, so that's definitely not a solution to remain pregnant for the remainder of my fertile years.\n\nIt took 11 months to get pregnant. I mainly utilized acupuncture to manage my cycle & symptoms, and worked myself to death to ignore it when possible. I had a high risk pregnancy, a traumatic emergency c-section, and breastfeeding issues afterwards. What a blessing. Then, despite breastfeeding full-time, my period and PMDD came back full on at only 10-weeks postpartum. It was complete misery and contributed a great deal to the PPD, PPA, and D-MER I struggled with. It didn't help that I had absolutely negligent postpartum care by both my OBGYN and PCP. \n\nWell, it's been 2 years and nothing is better. Multiple psychiatrists, changing OBGYNs, changing PCPs. Tried several mental health supports, birth control pills, vitamins... that haven't worked. I've finally, finally, finally gotten the medication I need for my ADD (oh yeah, that went unmedicated for almost 3 years from pregnancy to now too...). I've tried acupuncture again. Nothing is working. I can't take it anymore.\n\nDuring the luteal phase, I have the big bad unaliving thoughts that are totally uncontrollable. The rage I feel is indescribable. The inability to focus and exhaustion have been horrific and impact my ability to work. Weird food cravings, joint pain, migraines, hydration issues, racing thoughts. I feel like my mind & body are possessed. It's hurting my marriage, my job, my friendships, and takes me away from being a present mother.\n\nI'm conflicted about getting an IUD because I've had some complications in the past. I'm looking at getting a Mirena again because I've had a child so there should be more room in there for the device. I'd take the occasional depressive episode to what I'm dealing with for half the freaking month ... the PMDD feels so much worse because I may have been sad/down on the dumps with the IUD, but I wasn't having racing unaliving thoughts. I also frankly miss not having a period because my periods are horror shows in the amount of bleeding - I've been anemic in the past from it. I'm at that point where this just needs to stop. I'm so exhausted - physically & mentally - from trying to figure this out: cycle tracking, cycle activity syncing, cycle diet syncing, trying to get a month's worth of work done during the follicular phase because I'm going to be useless during the luteal phase, mood journals, constant doctors who don't believe me and me always taking on the burden of proof, acupuncture my insurance won't cover... the list goes on & on. I just want to enjoy a life I've worked so hard to have. Fingers crossed a new IUD could be the solution.",

Written in such a way that it sounds like they’re trying to do good,but if you read between the lines… we are all F’ed. \n\n          *Third, I think the first thing they are trying to be established is BC being NOT COVERED by insurance. Which also means that prices could be jacked up.  (My opinion based on what I read in the pdf)\n\nThe hope would be that it could be covered if deemed “medically necessary” for purposes other than birth control, like PMDD, PCOS, Endo, Fibroids, etc. \n\nI started on BC like, 20 years ago, and having it listed as “medically necessary” was the only way it was covered back then. (Maybe?) (I had debilitating cramps, super heavy flow, etc.)\n\nI currently struggle with getting a 90 day supply, as sometimes the preferred generic changes. Or the computer says it’s not up for renewal yet, as I take it continuously with no placebo week. \nFor a “90day supply” (ie 3 months) subtract 7 days because months are 30/31 days!! And then another 3 weeks from no placebo and suddenly my 3 month supply lasts two months. I had to have my doctor write the Rx to say do not take placebo, take one a day continuously in the instructions to make it work. \nfor PMDD, with no uterus!! (Best decision I’ve ever made- giant fibroids and endo, turns out)\n\nBut the way politics are headed😵‍💫🤬, your concerns ARE VALID and we should all be wary! (I could go into explanation of why re: p2025 and things said in speeches and interviews, but that’s not for this post/comment/page. But I will recommend reading the pdf online.)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I’ve seen many posts regarding copper IUDs and PMDD symptoms. I wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else had some more insight/similar experience. \n\nI was on low dose BC pills from 15 to 30. I did take a 6 month break when I was 29 and then almost a year at 30. During that time, my periods were very regular- every 28-30 days and only lasted 3 days. Only heavy bleeding the second day but no spotting or severe PMS symptoms the week prior. I would have 2-3 days before my period where I would have mental rage lol but I was aware of it and it was manageable. \n\nFast forward to March 2025 (I’m 32 years old now so off all birth control for over a year)- I got the paragard IUD because I needed something since I was becoming serious with my boyfriend and I didn’t want hormones. My older sister had the paragard for 10 years and didn’t complain about. HOWEVER, it did break when she got it removed and had to have surgery to remove the last piece. That being said, she still swore by it. So I got it! \n\nEvery month since then, I have 10 days of hell followed by 5 days of heavy bleeding for my period and 2 days prior, I start spotting. \nThe 10 days of hell are me crying, feeling insanely depressed, angry, impulsive, and very anxious. I looked into supplements for a time and my functional medicine doctor suggested bio identical progesterone. I wasn’t too keen on taking hormones since the whole point of the IUD was to not have hormones. I started magnesium, zinc, and DIM. That seemed to help the last two months but still not completely. I ran out of my supplements this month and PMDD symptoms came back with a vengeance. \n\nI completed a cycle mapping Dutch test (has anyone else done this?) as recommended by my functional medicine doctor to see where exactly my hormone ranges are during my period. I’m still waiting on those results. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight on this correlation? It’s been almost 6 months and while my periods are regular and I haven’t gotten pregnant, my luteal phase makes me feel like I’m not even in my own body and I never had this problem before the IUD.

The only thing that helped me was duphaston (progesterone only) , but my doctor wouldn't keep me on it long term, so every year I'd get a 4 month break of pmdd by being on it. \nAnyway 2 years ago, I randomly met a new doctor and she started me on a progesterone only drug called slynda. I take it everyday continuously with no break at all, I don't take the sugar placebo tablets. Well to say it has changed my life is an understatement. I literally do not have any symptoms at all.\nAfter roughly 11 months of being on it I got a period that had pmdd symptoms but I just kept taking the pill and then roughly 10 months later, I forgot the pill one night and the next day I got my period and pmdd (75%) symptoms and for no reason last month I got another period approx 50% symptoms. And other than that it's changed my life completely. The reason I write this is because years ago a woman wrote how she had tried duphaston and it had helped her and it always gave me hope that some day I'd find my no pmdd life. Keep searching and fighting.\n\n\n\nEdit: additionally information. I also tried the mini progesterone only pills Cerazette (Desogestrel) and Noriday (Norethisterone). They didn't help my pmdd at all. I don't know how to word this properly but my doctor told me they have slightly different chemical forms to slynda (Drospirenone) and that sometimes people have a better effect with one form over another. That's why I just tried anything available! Best of luck on your journey x",

I do feel that being on fluoxetine definitely does help with that too, but the bc is by far the biggest thing that impacts my body.

Getting back to normalcy is an experience in itself, but it’s good to get in touch with how your body works on its own without the interference of medication (especially before making any decisions on whether or not to take them). \nWishing you luck with it! x",

    "selftext": "So I’ve been experiencing literally every single PMDD symptom there is for the past 5 months including extreme fatigue, extreme back pain, whole body soreness, feel hot 24/7, freezing cold hands, sobbing relentlessly for no reason, insane anger, and literally going crazy all day long! \n\nI’ve tried Slynd for 5 days followed by Yaz for 3 days which made me even more insane and my symptoms worsened so I switched back to Seasonique for 2 days and it’s not working as well for some reason because it used to work but I get excessive sweating. \n\nThen after stopping for a week, I got my period which exacerbated all my symptoms but somehow I wasn’t insanely fatigued that I have to sleep for 12 hrs straight and then take a 3-4 hour nap during the day and still feel tired. \n\nNow my PMDD symptoms have lasted for 1 month straight nonstop and my period has just stopped by my PMDD symptoms have come back even stronger! I used to have no symptoms at all and just feel horrible during my period, then in May, I have better for 2 weeks after my period, then in June, I only feel better for 1 week after my period, and now right after my period, I still have severe back pain like a fell of a skyscraper and landed on my back and fatigue that feels like I’m being drugged and extremely drunk! \n\nI was wondering has anyone else experienced the same thing as me? And why does PMDD happen straight after my period? This shouldn’t happen right because your estrogen levels rise after periods not drop right? \n\nWhat should I do? Why aren’t the BC pills working at all when it used to work? Should I try them again? \n\nAlso I’ve read through my threads here and many women say only a hysterectomy has solved their PMDD symptoms but what if you’re very young and in your early twenties? No doctor would allow you to get a hysterectomy right? \n\nIs there anything else that has helped you reduce back pain and fatigue as these are my most prominent symptoms? \n\n\n",

        "text": "You feel shit because you took three different types of birth control within 10 days, which is totally *not* how they should be used. If a medical professional suggested you do that, you need a new one. \n\nBirth control works for PMDD by preventing ovulation. No ovulation = no symptoms. However, the hormones in birth control can also make you feel bad themselves. \n\nThey recommend you test any new birth control for *three months*, to ensure that it's working properly and your body has time to adjust. After three months, many people find that initial side effects go away. \n\nIf you have totally intolerable side effects, of course you can stop it earlier...but you should take a break before starting another pill. After throwing a load of hormones at your body and then taking them away, things can be off kilter for a month or two. \n\nI can't see why birth control would help your PMDD symptoms within a couple of days, as it's just not the mechanism of action by which they work. To my knowledge, it's estimated that it takes up to 7 days for birth control to prevent ovulation. \n\nTLDR; You've loaded your body with three different birth control pills, none of which you took frequently enough to prevent ovulation. You've likely thrown your hormones totally out of whack by doing this. I'd suggest taking a short break, before attempting again with *one* form of birth control for several weeks / months. Once you've stopped taking one, give yourself a break before moving onto the next. \n\nIf you want more information on how birth control works for PMDD, we have some great information in the wiki.\n\nEdit: Feeling hot, extreme pain, and cold hands aren't symptoms of PMDD and you should get them checked out by a medical professional.",

However it still is something you can pursue and with the right doctor make it happen. Check the child free sub for a list of doctors willing to sterilize child free young women. But know you have to have your ovaries out and go on hrt for the rest of your life if you want to combine it with a hysterectomy for progesterone intolerance if it's what you have. \n\nThis may take longer. In the meantime, you will want to immediately make an appointment with your primary care doctor to do blood work but ask for a metabolic panel with a close eye on the thyroid, to rule out, and look into starting an SSRI. As birth control is only kind of a management of symptoms type treatment that can help pmdd but an SSRI is what is called first line treatment usually",

    "selftext": "I’m nearly 37, and after a lifetime of chronic illness and disability, living with a severe and enduring ED, and finally surrendering the goal and desire to try to have a child, I am looking at all options to end this PMDD hell.\n\nFor 2-3 weeks of every month, as too many of you are familiar, I literally feel like dying. Hardcore, and scary, ideation kicks in (knowing it has a biological basis doesn’t help it wane), rage at everything and everyone (including my couldn’t-be-more-understanding husband), feeling more don on myself than I ever thought possible, hopelessness/apathy, and all the physical crap (not a full list, but some including: severe bloating/distention, weight gain which majorly fucks with my ED related body image, breast tenderness and swelling, overall changes and increases in puffiness to my body/face, exacerbation of all my underlying chronic illnesses and chronic pain conditions, migraines, nausea on the verge of vomiting, malaise, and so much more).\n\nI was on continuous birth control pills for a decade until going off on January of 2024, and was on the pill with monthly withdrawal bleeds for a decade before the continuous usage. I went on it continuously in 2014/15, BECAUSE the PMDD exacerbation of everything was making it impossible to endure the treatments I needed at that time for other underlying issues.\n\nI went off then January 2024 because I was using the goal of trying to get pregnant as a motivator for ED recovery, but so many things in the past 18 months, and especially since the beginning of this year, have made that a very clear non-option, and while not being a mother was the biggest pain point of my life for several years, I’m finally to the point where I’ve accepted it it’s not in the cards for me, and I’m going to be the best auntie I can be.\n\nI don’t know the appropriate place to add this note, so I’m just gonna throw it in here: in April, I finally came to the realization I’m asexual, and while I’ve been married for 15 years, this is a huge puzzle piece my  husband and I are trying to navigate. It also comes along with a lot of body dysphoria/chest dysphoria, and wearing a chest binder has been one of the most game changing things for me since April. I don’t have gender confusion, but I very much do not want to have/to be aware of any of the parts of my body that remind me I have an adult female’s body (chest, internal reproductive organs responsible for this cycle BS every month). So there’s a lot of mental and physical distress going on more often than not.\n\nSo I tried to go back on continuous birth control starting in May, and went back on the pill I was on for a decade prior (generic Seasonale), hoping it would help again. No dice. No such luck. If anything, things got worse. \n\nMy gynecologist has suggested surgical options could be the way to go (IUD is out for me, as are other methods like nexplanon, and we have radiation avoid other pills to past and recent experiences). \n\nSince I’m in my late 30s, I’m exploring a more permanent option. My doctor originally mentioned possibly a bilateral salpingectomy alongside ablation, or a hysterectomy, but the more I’m reading, the more I’m pretty sure I’m understanding the only thing that would truly help with PMDD in a surgical sense is a total oophorectomy. \n\nCan anyone tell me if that’s accurate, and can anyone who has had any of the above in an effort to manage symptoms of PMDD/get rid of PMDD weigh in and share your experiences and/or what you wish you’d known before making whatever decision you made? I know removing the ovaries also means being on HRT (I think for the remainder of life), and I also have mild osteoporosis from over 2 decades of ED crap, but if that’s the alternative to feeling like I want to die 3/4ths of every month, I honestly think going through forced menopause would ultimately be worth it. I’m just at my wits’ end here, and have no clue what the best option would be.\n\n*obligatory: not asking for medical advice, because I have an appointment with my GYB a week from today, jus want to know others’ experiences, opinions, knowledge about all this because I’m so lost*",

    "selftext": "I started on a low dose bc (norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol 1 mg/0.02 mg) three weeks ago and I feel worse than I’ve felt in a very long time.\n\nI have insomnia and depression that were responding extremely well to meds - right up until I started birth control. It had been years since I had experienced suicidal ideation - right up until I started birth control. I’m overwhelmed by how completely awful I feel. Extremely irritable, hopeless, worthless.\n\nHas anyone started a pill, felt REALLY horribly bad for weeks and then eventually felt better than before starting it? I expected some side effects at first, but I didn’t imagine it could send me back into 14 year old girl levels of angst and misery. \n\nCan anyone share any relevant experiences? \n\nI just don’t see how this can be my solution if the adjustment phase is this bad.\n\nEdited to add: Thanks to everyone who commented. I appreciate your taking the time to be helpful.\n\nI hate to give up on something before the recommended adjustment period is over, but I just cannot handle this right now and I’m quitting this pill. I’m trying not to feel like a failure. But I do think that if I explained to a doctor how intensely bad I feel, they would likely tell me to stop taking it. \n\nPreviously, I’ve always given it at least the full three months before deciding to switch. But these symptoms are unbearable, especially right now when I’m trying to enjoy my holiday plans. \n\nMaybe I’ll start something different next year.",

She said if I'm having suicidal ideations or much worse mental health symptoms, to stop the birth control because it wouldn't end up working for me in the long run AND it's just not a good idea to take a med that is making you spiral.\n\n \n\nI think if you're having suicidal ideations and suddenly symptoms that you had managed before are coming back full force, you should review immediately with your psychiatrist/doctor, and if I were in your shoes, I would quit taking the pill for now (as long as I wasn't at risk of pregnancy). The SI can be dangerous and things can spiral quickly. Usually that's advised by all doctors and pharma companies if you experience a sudden uptick in suicidal thoughts.",

I take Wellbutrin as well because after the 3 months I had some low level depression that was not at all the same depressed feeling I had with PMDD. But I was stable which was the most important element to me. I suspect I was already depressed and experiencing PME for that on top of the PMDD. The severity of the reaction doesn’t necessarily indicate its effectiveness. I would suggest taking it continuously too, if your doctor agrees. \n\nThe whole thing with PMDD is that we react to *changes* in hormones, not the hormones themselves (unless you have another disorder that does react to hormones themselves). And birth control is a big change! I mean we’re shutting off an entire system and cycle of something in your body. In a weird world where someone might have to shut off their entire digestive system without removing any organs, I would expect that to take a while and be extremely uncomfortable. \n\nI can completely understand why people give up on it as an option before the three months is over because it was awful, so they take it as a sign it’s the wrong choice. But I was at the end of my rope and realized I was miserable all the time anyway so I didn’t have a lot to lose. I could sign up for 3 months of misery with the chance of a light at the end of the tunnel, or the rest of my life in misery with no hope of being better (I’d consider the oopherectomy route eventually). I will also say I was extremely lucky that at that period in time I wasn’t working and had just moved to a new city, tail end of COVID restrictions, so I didn’t have to be at normal operating levels.",

    "selftext": "Hey friends 💕\n\nCan’t believe I’m sitting here having a day I feel like a normal human. This hasn’t happened in a few weeks 🙃\n\nI’m at kind of a crossroads here treatment wise. I have seen a functional medicine doctor& gotten hormone tests done. This is very expensive and his recommendation is like 10 different supplements, which again, very expensive. \n\nI’m not tooootally against this but I’m just so worried this isn’t really going to keep my PMDD AND Endo pain at bay. His thought is this is an inflammation thing and if we reduce inflammation I’ll have less pain and less PMDD effect.  The cons here would be continued issues which already feel hopeless, and it’s a lot of money to just “try” out. I’d also lose time obviously, this will take a few months to reevaluate. \n\nMy other option is BC. I have had bad experience with BC pills in the past, but that was over ten years ago and I don’t remember the pill it was. My Mirena IUD (still have) had me feeling good for nearly 8 years before my symptoms came back! I have this theory that maybe Mirena suppressed my ovulation for a long time and now it’s not anymore, which is why I was thinking something like Slynd to suppress ovulation. This obviously will take time to try to and I definitely worry about the side effects.  \n\nI know no one can tell me what I should do, but I just wanted to get some thoughts on this \n:( I’m really struggling. I’m barely getting through each month. I worry if I go the “more natural” route it won’t be a long term solution or it won’t help enough. I know for some people BC pills saved their life. On the other hand they come with a lot of side effects. \n\nI am barely a functional human, just worried that whatever I choose will be wrong 💔\n\nETA: my super nice GYNO is out on maternity leave and the office says she doesn’t show appts being available until FEBRUARY so I can’t talk to her about it😭",

It makes it almost impossible to gauge each new med’s benefits, side effects, and how it interacts with all the other meds or vitamins.   So not only you wont know what it does or doesnt do, but will be hard to finetune dosing, combinations if you leave this dr. \n\nId try one thing for 2-3 cycles, see how it goes and then go from there to finetune and add things on. \n\nJust me, but I would go bc or SSRIs and then supplement ( start one at a time with vitamins). Reality is that this disease is just way too destructive and brutal. Search previous posts on this sub. So many people try ‘natural’ first and for many years, but most find that they are still struggling decades later….there is a reason that bc and/or SSRIs are top line recommended treatments. They are evidence-based and are shown to have most likely to be effective. \n\nFor insight on specific treatments, check out the wiki on this sub and also see previous posts on the topic. It is very active so you will find lots of experiences, information and advice.  \n\nBut, these wont be any indicator on whether the med will help you or you will have a bad reaction -  everyone’s biology is different, so the only way to know if it works for you and how you will go is to try it.  And yes, trying can be exhausting, emotional and scary, but hey…if you keep trying, there is at least a chance that you will get better. Otherwise you are stuck in this misery forever and forever.   As long as you keep trying treatments, you can’t make a ‘wrong’ choice.",

Nothing too too expensive and the first three are pretty commonplace.  The flax seed is just tryptophan.  I still don't know what a collagen peptide is.

It genuinely changed my life for the better and despite my fiancé having his own birth control, I still stay on it because it makes my periods SO much more manageable in every way. I would encourage you to give it a try, because it really doesn’t sound like the way you’re existing now is sustainable. \n\nEven if you don’t want to take the yaz, I urge you to try the lexapro.

    "selftext": "My lovely fellow moderator u/DefiantThroat has shared great research and personal experiences with PERT. It has been so helpful to me as I navigate perimenopause on top of PMDD. I want to detail my HRT PMDD journey here in case it can help anybody out.\n\nI'm 42 and a half. My PMDD symptoms started right away with my first periods. I took various combination birth control pills for 15 years starting at 19 to avoid pregnancy. It made my PMDD worse. My husband got a vasectomy and I stopped taking bcp around eight years ago.\n\nThe physical symptoms really ramped up in the last three years or so. I regularly experienced \"the period flu\" and then terrible leg pain. Every joint in both legs hurt and felt swollen. It was truly debilitating. I've also started with genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms and was diagnosed with lichen sclerosis.\n\nI'm using topical estrogen twice per week and I'm on 0.1 mg estradiol patches (I change the patch on Wednesdays and Sundays). I started the topical estrogen last year sometime. I started the patches with a progestin only birth control, Slynd, three months ago. My doctor wanted me to try that because I was still cycling regularly and that brings spikes in estrogen at my age. Her thinking was let's shut the whole cycle down while protecting my uterus and add estrogen back with the patches. I tried it and didn't make it through the whole pack. I completely melted down. I was so depressed even though I continued to take an antidepressant every day. \n\nMy doctor gave me the green light to discontinue Slynd and take 100 mg of micronized progesterone 12 days per month to protect my uterus instead. It's going pretty well. My legs feel back to normal and my mood and other PMDD symptoms are good. The only weird thing is I'm not getting a real period. This is my second month on estrogen patches and micronized progesterone and I'm just bleeding very little, more like spotting than an actual period. I'm not experiencing a real luteal phase or period, so even though it's a little unsettling not to bleed for real, I feel good so I'm happy with it.\n",

My impulses just got so bad as I got put on the pill which I tried for 2 of those months, which was terrible and ended dangerously after a life threatening attempt and 11 days in hospital with surgery & and now broken up with and I have to fly the other side of the world back home. All in 11 days. I’m really going through it guys oh my gosh…\n\nBut my question is about PMDD and trauma.. I have gone through a bit growing up and witnessed toxicity within my parents. Though I feel like I did work within myself and I genuinely felt healed until I got into a relationship. \n\nFrom what I can remember- my PMDD episodes weren’t so bad, if anything, when I was single. With him when I was in my luteal phase it genuinely triggered the worst and trauma induced sides of me which I never thought would surface to anyone. I don’t recognise myself. I feel like I’ve gone so backwards and anything I built up, confidence, self love and independence just disappeared and I feel like an anxious, angry and scared child.\n\nI really hate it about myself but I am hurting so bad. Some people just won’t understand but hopefully someone out there does. There’s also some other complications within our relationship. I moved across the world within a week of knowing him and lost my whole identity and support network so I felt incredibly isolated and dependent on him. He was also so bad at communicating and I felt very misunderstood which used to make me rage in luteal. I think that just killed me too. I’m sorry for all of this info.. I’m just trying to make sense of things and maybe get help to gather a perspective in this dark time.\n\nIt’s sad because I have tried for the past 5 months to get help and the help I have got has made my situation so much worse. I guess I just want to know if anyone else has any input into this or if anyone relates.. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Sorry if this is stupid but it’s 1am here and I have a suspected UTI. ChatGPT suggested I either call 999 immediately (lol no thanks) or try some buscopan. My partner has IBS so I woke him up to ask where it was and he said in his “left pocket pouch”. He is really anal about this little pouch that contains all his emergency stuff like bank cards, immodium, airpods, and apparently now also two condoms. The ones you have to order that are “your size” so he can’t have them for other people. I’ve been on the pill since one year after we met. Been together 5 years all together and he proposed in Feb. \n\nObviously I need to speak with him but a) it’s the middle of the night, b) I don’t want to sound like a crazy paranoid person, and c) maybe there is a rational explanation??? Is there? Is this a normal thing to do? I don’t get periods anymore due to early perimenopause. We don’t do anal so it wouldn’t be for a horny butthole emergency in a layby either. Maybe guys use them when they masturbate in their work vans or something? Idk what to think. They’re not cheap either. Pls help I can’t sleep. \n\nEdited to add: they’re expired. Mystery (probably) solved. Thank you!!! \n\nEdit 2: he drove me to the hospital to pick up my antibiotics and the drive is about 30mins. I started with “So I’m gonna tell you a funny story, but please promise you won’t be mad at me…” then I told him everything, plus all the paranoid thoughts I’d had, the suspicions, etc. and in the end we both ended up laughing about how ridiculous the whole situation was. Of course they were left over from when we first dated and he said he carried them “just in case”. “Just in case you feel like cheating!!!?” I jokingly shouted at him. No in case I miss my pill or (relevant part) I have to take antibiotics. \n\nSo then I asked, but why are they in your LPP? When we have sex only at home? And he said in case we travel, I’ll always have some on me. We did go on holiday abroad together once and we stay at his mom’s sometimes. So the reason is: he wants to be prepared for all eventualities, that’s why the LPP exists and why it’s filled with so many different things. (LPP = Left Pocket Pouch (TM) like a handbag insert but for men’s trouser pockets. \n\nThanks everyone for your input, advice and words of caution against ChatGPT! It helped me a lot and kept my mind busy when I couldn’t sleep from the pain. I appreciate you! ",

It was 5 days a month of pure agony and torture. \n\nAfter a particularly rough cycle, I realized I didn’t have to live this way and found an online company for birth control. \n\nIt’s now been four months and….oh my gosh I can actually FUNCTION during my cycle now! In fact, my flow is so light that I didn’t have light enough pads/tampons and had to go buy a box of panty liners. \n\nOh and as a bonus, my boobs have filled out and I actually fill a whole A cup again! \n\nBut jokes aside, I am SO RELIVED that I have the option to get this medication easily and I really REALLY hope the current administration doesn’t change that. I love the light periods, less acne, better mood, and plumper boobs! ",

To keep things kind of short, my partner and I had trouble conceiving for years, and after 6 years and a missed miscarriage, we finally conceived our daughter. She's now about 3 ½ months old and she's the light of our lives. So, you see, we didn't necessarily believe that we would ever conceive again, or at least it would be a while before it happened again, so I didn't feel the urge to start birth control. Well, I'm 6 weeks pregnant. I've known for a week, and I've been struggling to really think about it, emotions are high and it's making the decision harder. Right now is just not the time to be adding to our family, not to mention the risks involved being pregnant so soon after a c section. I want this future baby, I don't really feel anything except this very slight feeling of attachment, I guess because I feel responsible for it now? However, I know keeping it is not the right choice. I can get abortion pills shipped to me for $75. I know this is the right decision for us. I'm just worried that it may haunt me for the rest of my life... I'm 100% pro choice but I've always hoped I'd never be put in the situation to choose, but here I am, and it's been such a decision. \n\nHas anybody here ever been in a situation like mine, where you were struggling to choose abortion or keeping the pregnancy? If you chose to terminate, how do you feel about it now? I could really use some insight into what the future may be like. Chatgpt can only help but so much haba\n\n\nEdit:\nWow, I didn't expect to get this much attention! I ordered the pills, and took them over the weekend. I don't regret it, and I feel so relieved! I'm starting birth control today and won't be having sex until I know they're working. I appreciate all of your concerns, and thank you guys for helping me look at things rationally! It felt impossible to make the decision by myself, and thanks to all of you wonderful people, I didn't have to. ❤️ Thank you guys so, so much for helping this internet stranger.",

I am aware that men are individuals and there are still good men out there.\n\nI’ve always known that some(depending where you look) men are generally shallow (focusing on the external appearance of women is hardwired into their biology moreso than women) and misogynistic, but on Reddit/online it seems as though the grand majority of them are.\n\nGroups specifically for men are often the worst (I can’t name which ones because I don’t want my account to be banned). Someone will make a post asking about women and hoards of men will say the most degrading, insulting, hateful, and misogynistic things straight out of Andrew Tate/Redpill communities. Like how women start to lose their worth and value after age 25 (a lot of comments about “hitting the wall”), degrading women who have a body count (ew I hate that term) over 1 (even tho they themselves often have a body count in the double-digits and don’t see a problem with it), promoting trad-wife culture, making fun of women who chose not to have kids, immediately blaming women for any divorce/breakup, etc. If you scroll through the comments section of any of these posts, you will see hundreds or thousands of upvotes on the most unhinged hateful things, which makes me fear that the majority of men truly believe that cr*p.\n\nThe men in my family are not like this (at least not outwardly and they’ve never said anything like this) so it’s kind of shocking to see how many men are. My ex was a redpill misogynist who cheated on me throughout the relationship and used a lot of redpill terms/tactics (negging me to make me feel insecure, rated me as a 6/10 on a scale despite me asking him not to, generally saw women as lesser than, got a kick out of emotionally manipulating me, admitted to liking Trump/redpill content towards the end of our relationship). He was also on Reddit a lot and learned a lot of the game/pick-up artistry stuff (to which I was completely oblivious about until I dated him) on Reddit forums. (Side note: unsurprisingly, he was also the least attractive man I’ve ever dated, which is something I was initially blind to/willing to look past because he love-bombed me and I fell for him. He was 5’7” with a less than average equipment, I but anyways…I digress!). I thought he was just an oddball, not representative of the majority of men, but not I’m not so sure anymore. \n\nSeeing all the terrible hateful comments men have to say about women behind the secrecy of an anonymous account online, I am starting to become paranoid that most men truly do think this way but are afraid to admit it because they know it makes them look bad. I’m feeling super disillusioned with dating and men in general and fear that my previous optimism about men in my teens and 20s (most men are generally good people and don’t think this way) was just youthful naivety. Also, maybe I had a better perception of men back then because (let’s face it) men are generally much nicer to women in their teens and 20s than 30s+. I am feeling pretty pessimistic about men today and I’m not sure if I’m finally waking up to reality after decades of ignorance or if I’m just seeing the worst of the worst and need to get off the cesspool of the Reddit manosphere. Or maybe a bit of both.\n\n\n",

In simple terms, the need for more workers should be related to the number of people existing. In my town, we have one McDonald’s. They are always hiring for a variety of reasons but it would be unreasonable to suggest that people should have more children so that McDonald’s always has enough workers. If we doubled the population, then we could support another McDonald’s but it would still be the same number of people in my town per McDonald’s so that doesn’t create more people willing to work at MCDonalds.

    "title": "The reality of women in India",
    "selftext": "The recent news of a medical student being gang-raped and left for dead in India has shaken me to my core. What baffles me even more than the crime itself are the public reactions to the victim. While many sympathize and call for justice, there is a rising tide of finger-pointing and victim-blaming.\n\nI read countless comments under YouTube news reports blaming the girl because she went out for dinner with a male friend and was deemed \"too modern.\" Some went as far as using smiley emojis, stating she \"deserved it\" for having a boyfriend. Disturbingly, I'd consider her case relatively mild compared to the depths of depravity I've seen in others.\n\nOne such case is the murder of Manisha in Bhiwani, Haryana—a state with one of the worst sex ratios in India. She was a teacher who wanted to become a nurse. After going to a nursing college near her home to get an admission form, she was found in a secluded area, mutilated. Her internal organs had been removed, and her face was completely mangled by acid to prevent recognition. This is the level of brutality women suffer.\n\nI am entrusting you to make people around the world aware of the condition of India because we are silenced here every day. You might see candlelight marches, but they mean nothing when the judicial system actively protects perpetrators by blaming victims, the police mishandle cases—often concluding \"suicide\"—and society consistently blames the victims.\n\nI am sick of this. I am sick of staying silent and sweeping things under the rug to protect the reputation of my community and country, pretending this is normal. This affects me every single day, and we aren't even allowed to talk about it. Whenever I try to discuss these cases, people zone out.\n\nSo, this is the true reality of India, and I want not just Indian women but every woman in the world to know:\n\n\n1.\t⁠The Extreme Violence of Rape in India -\n\nRape here is rarely just rape; it often means death or unimaginable brutality. It's the total annihilation of the victim. Victims are mutilated, humiliated, and tortured. They have their intestines pulled out, genitals mutilated, and are burned or have foreign objects inserted into them. This level of violence requires a collapse of empathy so profound it borders on psychopathy. This collapse doesn't emerge from nowhere; it's engineered by systems and environments. It's not about pleasure but sadism. Don't think wives are spared—there was a woman hospitalized after her wedding night, with doctors reporting it looked like she had been gang-raped by her new husband.\n\n2.\t⁠Society’s Indifference and Encouragement -\n\nIndia remains medieval in its beliefs. The use of violence to \"discipline\" women, children, and minorities is widely encouraged and accepted. Rape is seen as a disciplinary tool for \"bad women\" who dare to step outside the house, get a job, get an education, or have a boyfriend. It is a punishment for transgressing patriarchal values and exercising autonomy. Even women blame other women, often stating that having a boyfriend or even a male friend is a transgression significant enough to justify rape. A Dalit woman, Bhanwari Devi, was raped simply for trying to prevent the child marriage of a one-year-old girl. In another case, a tribal girl was gang-raped, and judges acquitted the perpetrators because she had run away with her lover—a part of her community's marriage tradition. The Brahmin judges deemed her \"vulgar\" and therefore deserving of the rape. This idea that certain women deserve to be raped fuels countless attacks. Shame is so entrenched that many victims are forced to marry their perpetrators.\n\n3.\t⁠Underreporting and Low Conviction Rates -\n\nMany Indian men claim women file false rape cases, but the truth is we live in a shame-based society where an estimated 90% of rape cases go unreported due to familial and societal pressure to maintain \"honor.\" Families often pressure victims to forget what happened because going to the police would \"bring shame.\" They would rather never speak of it, also because the system is corrupt and unresponsive. Even if a victim pursues justice, she is often taunted and re-victimized for losing her \"purity.\" Police frequently dismiss and mock victims, mishandle evidence, and conduct minimal inquiry, often after being bribed. Judges often blame women, asking why they didn't do more to prevent it, and have even forced minor girls to carry their rapists' babies.\n\n4.\t⁠Systemic Devaluation of Women and Girls -\n\nThe Indian government banned gender-based abortions in 1994, but they are still prevalent. Before her organs are fully formed, a female fetus is often rejected from her mother's womb. These decisions are predominantly dictated by the men in the family (husband or father-in-law), and the pregnant woman is rarely consulted. Tragically, elder women in the family, especially mother-in-laws, often support these terminations. Women who give birth to girls face more abuse and domestic violence. A woman only gains respect after birthing a son. This brainwashing is so deep that a woman with only daughters is seen as \"less than.\" This devaluation never stops—not when she manages the home, not when she earns money (employed women often face more domestic violence). In a cruel twist, elderly Indian women are frequently abandoned by their beloved sons, leading to a huge population of abandoned widows.\n\n5.\t⁠The Hypocrisy of Goddess Worship -\n\nMany Westerners see the many goddesses in Hinduism and assume Indians revere women. The truth is, the ideal set for an ordinary Indian woman is not the demon-slaying Kali or the powerful Durga, but Sita—the pure, obedient, servile, and virtuous wife who lives in her husband's shadow. Purity in Hinduism isn't just about virginity; it's about deep devotion to one's husband. A fleeting fantasy about another man can render a woman \"impure.\" Nobody wants their wives or daughters to be like Kali; those goddesses are for worship, not for emulation.\n\n6.\t⁠Purity Culture and Male Entitlement -\n\nIndia is a sexually repressed society that is also one of the largest consumers of porn. It's a country where marital rape is legal and women are often forced to breed until a son is born. Male entitlement over women's bodies runs deep. A popular phrase among Indian men is \"no seal, no deal,\" meaning they won't marry a woman without an intact hymen. But does this mean they leave non-virgin women alone? Unsurprisingly, no. They often exploit these women, pressuring them into relationships and sex (using the logic, \"she's already lost it, why not with me?\"), using sweet-talk or shame. When they are done, they discard her to marry the \"innocent village girl\" their parents found. There's also a horrid tradition in certain communities where the blood-stained bedsheet from the wedding night is presented to relatives to prove the bride's purity. If she doesn't bleed, her father is shamed, and the marriage is annulled. Activists who try to stop this tradition have been violently beaten.\n\n7.\t⁠Patriarchy and Anti-Feminism -\n\nThe red-pill movement is extremely popular among Indian men. Despite having the power to commit crimes with impunity, they often cast themselves as the victims. While there are cases of men being financially victimized (often due to a corrupt judicial system and the absence of unilateral no-fault divorce), these instances don't compare to the number of women killed for dowry or for not bearing sons. Indian men often want a \"traditional provider\" wife who earns money, does all the chores, and remains subservient, caring for his kids and in-laws without asking for decision-making power. Any woman who speaks about her experiences is labeled a \"feminist\" and dogpiled, while patriarchy is revered. Any woman exercising autonomy is severely punished—recently, a woman was set on fire by her husband and in-laws because she earned money by making reels.\n\n\nI know most of these points might sound like the rant of a disgruntled woman, but I am truly frightened by how apathetic Indian society is toward its own women. I am only depicting the negative side because until we sort this issue out, I don't care about the positive. I am sad and disappointed.\n\nMy intention is to tell the world the real plight of Indian women, hoping that some global criticism might force Indians to introspect about the future they are building. After all, reputation is everything to them. I also want your help in making Indian women aware of their own brainwashing, because they are just as responsible for the devaluation of girls. A society that devalues its daughters deserves to not have any.\n\n\nEDIT: I reached out to u/BurbNBougie, a YouTuber I’ve followed for a while, and she kindly decided to cover this topic on her channel. I really appreciate her for taking the time to discuss it: https://youtu.be/PygwQ_fCtwc?si=YFe0s11AkxasaV1G",

Isn’t it sad that it’s normal for us to be harassed? That’s the life of a woman. \n\nNot long ago, a British Indian 30 year old woman tells me she’s not a feminist. Me and another friend very quickly and proudly said we are and told her the definition to, to educate a supposedly highly educated person. It’s sad that there are so many women who think it’s a bad word.

    "title": "I’m in a state where abortion is completely legal and I was still treated like crap",
    "selftext": "I am 39 and have significant endometriosis.  I was told at 24 I could not naturally get pregnant because my tubes were totally blocked.  100% on one side and 95% on the other.  This was confirmed during four endo surgeries and my insurance covered my egg retrievals at 32 since we knew I would need IVF to get pregnant.\n\nSo color me SHOCKED when Tuesday of this week I’m staring at a positive pregnancy test.  I’m married and want kids.  The big but is I was in a major car accident in the fall of 2023 and my body is not yet put back together.  I’m having my 4th surgery in April (I’ve been trying my best to work and stay employed in between surgery) and my doctor said I needed to wait 3 months to really let my back heal before starting IVF which was fine by me.  I have a large herniation at l4/l5 that is weakening the nerves in my left leg so putting any weight on top of that herniation could damage the nerve function of my leg or legs permanently.  I always thought I couldn’t get pregnant so I went off the pill to regulate my period for IVF but that was dumb of my husband and I to not use back up protection because these things happen!\n\nWhen I went off the pill though my husband and I discussed that if I did get pregnant we would terminate until I was done having surgeries to fix my back.  So as soon as we saw that positive pregnancy test we knew what had to happen.  But being that I have never been in this situation I had no idea what to do and even though abortion is legal in my state I am thoroughly disappointed in the events that transpired over the next 48 hours.\n\nI called my IVF/endo dr because I wanted a scan to make sure the pregnancy wasn’t ectopic.  They said sorry, it’s a natural pregnancy, not our problem.  I’ve been seeing this Dr for 15 years so disappointed isn’t even the words to describe.  So I called my gyno next asking to come in for a scan, but also explaining my current medical situation and that I would need help pursuing termination and they immediately changed tone and said we have nothing to do with that here, here’s a number of a place that can help you.\n\nI started to get very nervous about an ectopic so I went to the ER.  They confirmed I was indeed 5 weeks pregnant, but they couldn’t see the pregnancy yet due to the early stage and couldn’t rule out ectopic or not.  The Dr was kind and said he did not think it was ectopic and if I wanted to move forward with a medical abortion that would be ok.  He agreed that with the current state of my spine, carrying a baby was not a good idea.  I checked out the hey Jane app and they confirmed my insurance does not cover abortions so to purchase the pills through them it would be $500.  I have a good job but it makes me sick to my stomach how much just a pack of pills costs.\n\nAnyway so I go to the clinic recommended by my gyno with my husband and holy sketch balls.  They weren’t there are my appt time so we called and they said they would be over in 30 mins.  30 mins turned into an hour.  The dr and his secretary/wife? arrived and the dr is in flip flops.  My husband and I both start to get cold feet and tried to back out but the secretary separated my husband and I by making him go back to the waiting room (which I get in hindsight because I’m sure they have seen plenty of situations where the partner is pressuring the woman one way or another).  So they bring me into a room and ask a few intro questions and then get right into the money, I’m asked to produce $510 cash.  \n\nI didn’t realize the dr was male when I made the appt and I didn’t want a transvaginal US by a male dr so I said I did not want one and we could go off my results from the er the day before.  The dr seemed offended by that, caught an attitude but just said “if you want the pills then we can give you the pills and that’s it, is that what you want?”.  I sat for a second and figured I get them here or I get them from the app and they may not come or something so I said ok let’s do it.\n\nThey had me do a urine pregnancy test which was still positive and then told me I had to take the first dose there.  I get that too because they want to make sure you’re not buying them for someone else but it was Thursday night, and I needed to go to work on Friday.  After having 3 surgeries I have no paid sick time left.  They insisted I take the first dose there so I said let me just go 100% double check with my husband before doing so (again I get how this could look bad but it’s both our baby and I didn’t want to take the first dose without him knowing) so I went out to the waiting room and said I’m gonna take the first dose, we’re both on board? And the general feeling is we both obvious don’t WANT me to have an abortion but both know I NEED to have abortion for my health.  I currently can’t feel my thighs because of my back injury and I can’t imagine how much worse it could get.\n\nOk so I take the first dose of misopristol which burned my lips and throat, wtf is that about!? This was about 6, I had to take another dose at 9 and another dose at 12.  The meds kick in quick and I was super cramp and nauseous for about 6 hours and then things stepped down to a normal period style pain.  I did need to take an unpaid 1/2 day from work so there goes another $250.\n\nI obviously shared with some people what was going on and of course I got “well you don’t know, they could have done your surgery while pregnant” or you could have been out of work on disability and basically a million reasons why I didn’t have to go through with it but no to all of it.  I feel terrible on a normal day…that would only have gotten worse.  I wanted to make the decision quickly because I’ve heard the further along you are the more painful it will be and Im in enough pain on the daily.  My husband and I were also concerned about the insane ebbs and flows of our political climate and as much as things are legal in my state…who knows what we may wake up to tomorrow.  My best friend was like you better get pills in your hand asap if you definitely want to do this but then was shocked pikachu when I told her it was done.  \n\nSo many things about the past 72 hours had blown my mind from my gyno and repro just completely dismissing me even though I had genuine concerns about MY heath with this pregnancy.  The fact that even though it’s legal I’m still get care in a sketchy ass basement by a Dr in flip flops with his secretary counting out my $500 cash on the counter.  So if this is the good legal care…what in the fuck is happening in other states?  Im a hs teacher and im not dumb my kids are hooking up in the bathroom, where is one of my 16 year olds getting $500 cash let along a ride to one of these drs to get help?  I feel angry at myself for not realizing how bad things still are.  And then I’m disappointed at how many people are surprised that I chose myself first.  Yes I want kids.  But if it’s meant to be, I will get pregnant in 4-5 months when my surgery is done and I am healed.\n\nSorry for the long rant.  I hope this helps someone.  Maybe I was rash and maybe in a few years I’ll look back at this post and think I made a mistake.  But I didn’t want to get to emotionally attached that I couldn’t follow through with the decision I had made when I was not in that emotional state.  Thanks for reading.",

I took Plan B about 5 weeks ago, maybe 6. I tested up to 27 days later and got all negatives. This morning, it came back 1-2 weeks. We think with how I'm feeling it's likely to be more 3-4 weeks. Please, don't tell me congratulations. I have never, ever wanted to be in this position, and I'll be going ahead with medical abortion - I don’t even know how this has happened. I'm petrified, I'm nauseous, I'm so worried I'm gonna end up throwing up - I have SEVERE emetophobia, I work from home and I rarely go out - I'm all over. I've done everything to avoid this for years - I'm 26 now - and I've finally slipped up with the pill.\n\nCan anyone who's had a medical abortion before please give me some insight. I'm petrified. I've called a line and left my name, dob and number and I'm waiting to hear from them. Me and my boyfriend are also going to go to a walk in health clinic today.\n\nI heard back and they’re asking me to wait until Thursday to talk to them, and then another appointment after which will likely be the following week. I don’t feel like I can do this. Mentally I’m not coping whatsoever and I’m freaking out. \n\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI know I can’t reply to everyone but I just wanted to thank you all so, so, so much. I’m petrified - both the pregnancy, and the possibility of sickness. But, I don’t feel as alone or ashamed anymore. It’s hard to express.. I’m not ashamed, but I am, too. I’m sad I have to do this, but more upset I let this happen. But you have all been so kind to me, and it has helped so dearly.\n\nMy sweet boyfriend is upset, he also doesn’t want children but still feels emotional. He’s been there for me, and will be for the next few weeks to hold my hand through it all.\n\nI have called for an emergency anti-emetics prescription and should hear from my doctor in the next hour or two. I’ve been cramping for days, but it’s been more prevalent today, maybe cause I’m anxious and I’ve just found out. I have a call tomorrow for my mental health (my emetophobia funnily enough) so I will see if I can rush through the appointment with the clinic, but it’s unlikely. For now, that’s scheduled for Thursday. It’s also likely we will look at trying another form of contraceptive like the injection so there’s no chance of me missing it as this isn’t something I want to have to do ever again, and I haven’t even gotten to the hard part.",

I do not regret it. \n\nMy sister was with me the whole time, i highly recommend having someone with you. We went to Marie Stopes in Ealing, they were great. \n\nWhen we got there, there was no one outside, which I had been worried about. Once checked in, I had to speak with 2 or 3 different people. Each time they checked that I knew what I was there for, and talked me through the procedure. I had to have an ultrasound to check the embryo was still there, I could choose to view it or not. I chose to look. I think they do this as the process is different if the embryo is no longer viable on its own. \n\nI then had the first pill, which terminated the pregnancy. I had to sit in the waiting room for a while for this part. \n\nThen after however long, I really can't remember, they brought me back and gave me another pill to start the explusion. Again, I had to wait in the waiting room for a while after taking the pills. \n\nOne set of the pills you put by your gums, so between your teeth and your lips, it allows for faster absorption, don't remember which it was though. May well have been both.\n\nOnce they were sure the process had started, we were allowed to leave. We took a taxi home instead of public transport. \n\nIt was horrible. I wouldn't wish it on anybody, but I also don't regret it, like I said. You will have severe cramps, and a lot of blood. I bled through my pads onto my house mates sofa, which added an extra flavour of embarrassment to the experience. I would say to buy those leak proof sheets, plastic backed, for your sofa and bed before hand. Get the most absorbant pads you can find, and lots of them. Funnily enough, post natal pads might be best, as they are really thick and meant to catch the blood after giving birth. Yes you bleed then too. \nAlso, lots of pain killers, hot water bottles, blankets and some good movies that you can loose yourself in. \n\nI have tried to be as honest as I can here, so that you can go into it knowing what to expect. If you have any questions, feel free to message me.\n\nEdited to add time frame wise, I found out when I was 4 wks, had all the appts and check ups, I had the abortion at 7 wks I think. I suffered from awful morning sickness and was really miserable throughout. My husband (then boyfriend) says it was our worst year together as I was so hormonal the entire time, first from the pregnancy, the from the combined pill as they wouldn't put me back on the could for a good 6 month or so.",

    "title": "Hormonal imbalance after coming off the pill",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m hoping someone out there might have the answers I’m looking for, or has maybe shared a similar experience.\n\nSo I’m 25 years old and I came off the pill (Yasmin) in January 2025 after almost 7.5 years on it and since then, I’ve had 7 cycles and they still haven’t returned to a regular pattern. I’ve been tracking my cycles closely using BBT and ovulation tests, and whilst my luteal phase has consistently been 12 days, my follicular phase has so far been very variable in length.\n\nMy ovulation days so far have been: 21, 26, 37, 18, 26, 33 (took the morning after pill this cycle) & 29.\n\nI had extensive blood tests done in August 2025 on cycle day 10. My FSH, LH & prolactin were normal, but my oestradiol was 112 pmol/L which is low for cycle day 10. My testosterone was right in the upper range of normal, and my free androgens were middle of the range. My doctor wasn’t concerned about PCOS, and I’ve no symptoms of PCOS, apart from irregular ovulation.\n\nIron, B12, folate, thyroid, liver, cholesterol etc. were all fine. However, red blood cells and white blood cells were right near the lower end of normal.\n\nBased on my research, I think the problem is that my body is sending the right signals to my ovaries (FSH), but my ovaries are being slow to respond in producing estrogen, which is why I’m then ovulating late. My doctor isn’t concerned and just said that for some women, it can take up to 18 months for their cycles to fully stabilise after coming off the pill.\n\nThe problem I’m having is that for my whole luteal phase, I feel like crap. As soon as I ovulate, I maybe have a couple more good days and then I start feeling really crappy until my period. I get insomnia and when I do fall asleep I don’t get much deep sleep, I’ve no energy, serious brain fog, no motivation, I feel sensitive and irritable, I can’t stop eating carbs and my skin’s breaking out. By the end of my luteal phase, I feel like I can’t function normally.\n\nAfter googling it, I think what might be happening is that my estrogen is staying low for my whole cycle. So when my body begins producing progesterone after ovulating, I don’t have enough estrogen to balance it out, which then causes all of those horrible symptoms throughout my luteal phase.\n\nAlso, since I came off the pill my periods have been much lighter than they were on the pill, which suggests to me that my womb lining isn’t thickening enough. Which supports my theory that I’m not producing enough estrogen - because estrogen is responsible for thickening the womb lining.\n\nHas anyone else been through this and when did your cycles stabilise? Does anyone have any tips for encouraging my body to produce more estrogen? Or if you disagree that the problem is sluggish estrogen production, please let me know what else you think could be going on.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that when I went on the pill, I had only got my first period 2.5 years before, and my cycles never became regular in that time. However, I remember my periods being a lot heavier than they are now.\n\nThanks in advance!!",

I don’t remember there being any major side effects when I started taking the pill either.

I take other medications and having one less thing to be on is appealing but I’m worried of the possible side effects of stopping. My doctor doesn’t seem to have concern either way. \n\nAny words of wisdom/thoughts from this community would be greatly appreciated!! TIA!!\n\nTL;DR: No longer need the pill for birth control.

It's a targeted medication that suppresses androgens, and helps cis women dealing with stubborn acne. It also doesn't have nearly the side effects of Accutane, like suicidal thoughts.\n\nI say cis because it is taken by trans women to help transition, and you can find lots of helpful info on Trans subs about it.\n\nI really think this is an androgen issue, but the other avenue to follow for stubborn acne is fungal treatments, but I would try specifically androgen-suppressing birth control or Spiro first.\n\nThat said, the emotions are tough.

    "title": "Changing political beliefs for a man",
    "selftext": "I just need to vent because this has been a hard pill to swallow. Since the most recent election I’ve lost a few friends who decided to abandon their previous morals (political beliefs) for shitty men and I just can’t wrap my head around it. \n\nFirst, I saw it happen with my best friend, we will call her Melissa. Melissa moved to a more conservative area, met a man who strung her along for a 1.5 years or so until they started having monthly relationship “check ins” and finally made it official and shortly after moved in together. I didn’t meet the man but I gathered he was a Joe Rogan podcast listener kind of guy, but my friend has always been very liberal so I hoped for the best and tried to talk to her about it. Long story short, when Trump was elected I found out she voted for him. I essentially “broke up” with her in a way where I said I could love her from afar but I was hurt by her actions. After that, I noticed her “liking” and reposting the most vile right-wing talking points, just views completely unlike her. \n\nIt’s been devastating to say the least, I feel so angry for how easily she abandoned her previous morals all for a man who doesn’t even respect her. The thing about Melissa is that she has never had much of a backbone, is insecure and has had shitty, toxic relationships where the man treats her like garbage and she just puts up with it despite everyone telling her she deserves better. She’s even joked about being a pick-me, and while I hate that term, I honestly feel like that’s exactly what she is. \n\nI’ve noticed it in a couple of friends. There’s another friend who I’ve drifted away from but thinking back we started drifting apart when she met her now husband. The only time I met her husband was at their wedding when they were doing their rounds and he made a “joke”about her 3 year old daughter (from a previous relationship) saying that she was “a b*tch sometimes”. Her THREE year old daughter. And not to mention when she introduced us to him he goes “who?” all rudely.  Suffix to say I could tell her was a trumpie boy and now I see her interacting with vile shit on Instagram too, most recently the anti-trans rhetoric around the recent shooting. \n\nAll this to say, I’m so incredibly disappointed, heartbroken, angry, sad to see these women just give up any sense of individuality and morals for shitty ass men. Both of these women were “nice” women who just picked shitty guys and bad relationship but had a good sense of right from wrong and now in the era of Trump they completely abandoned it. I don’t know how to reconcile with that and just move on. I understand brainwashing is a powerful thing but speaking on Melissa, she knew better. She was vocal during January 6 and all the shitty stuff from trumps last presidency. I can’t just let it slide because she knows this is bad and she chose it anyway. \n\nHas anyone else experience something similar? ",

Even now on the pill it's not regular, but at leadt it's quite short (3, 5 days max usually) and there's only a 7days ish window during which I can expect it. And it did SO MUCH for my emotional and hormonal regulation, and evetthing else. Basically it's working like a dream for me. I would be so so anxious to stop it and have to try out other methods...\n\n\nBut I'm also scared I could be causing great damage to my fertility and throwing my chances out of the window! Should I reconsider or has any of you or people around you seemingly had no great difficulty conceiving under similar circumstances? \n\nThank you si much.",

How long it takes to conceive is independent to you and your partner really. \n\nI was on bc for 13 years, took me 6 months to get pregnant (I’m 32). Took others I know, 1 month, and another 7 months. None of them needed medical intervention. But I don’t know their individual circumstances. \n\nThe advice I can offer is for you and your partner to get checked out by a doctor if you’re worried, get a clean bill of health, and take the chance. \n\nThe other advice is that a man’s health is way more important than it’s made out. Science has proven so recently, that a healthy man is key to a healthy pregnancy and baby. So make sure your partner is taking care of himself, cutting down on alcohol, eating well, exercising, etc. It doesn’t just fall onto you as the woman. ",

    "selftext": "When I hit puberty, everything hurt. My bone were in crippling pain, I couldn't walk from the leg pain and my body changed so rapidly my everything was swollen. The doctor said it was normal growth pains and just gave me painkillers. I suffered for over a week before the fluid bubbles behind my knee finally drained enough for me to walk.\n\nI had my first period at 13 and the pain was so intense I was vomiting, unable to eat, drink or sleep. They just kept getting worse every month and the bleeding was so heavy that I became iron deficient. The doctor said it was a hormonal imbalance and put me on the contraceptive pill (microginonn 30) to \"regulate\" my periods. I developed night terrors, an eating disorder, crazy mood swings and eventually at 18 years old I developed my first breat lump. Doctors biopsied, it wasn't cancer but needed to be removed. The surgery disfigured my breast and left a large scar. They changed my contraceptive pill (cerazette) to avoid more breast lumps.\n\nI'm 20 and my periods have stopped but so too has all libido and natural \"lubrication\" that occurs during intercourse with my long term boyfriend. Doctor says it's my only option and I should use synthetic lubricant to help. A weak later I'm rushed into hospital with a deep vaginal tear from intercourse. They knock me out with high dose morphine and determine I need stitches. I'm discharged but a week later I'm readmitted with a UTI. They give me antibiotics and discharge me. Two days later I'm rushed to intensive care, I have an infection in my bladder, kidneys and liver. I'm in crippling pain and stay in hospital for two weeks. When I'm discharged they recommend stopping the contraceptive pill to reduce a repeat of this kind of infection.\n\nI'm 21 and I have been suffering with panic attacks and violent night terrors. My doctor says I have a hormonal imbalance and puts me on the \"mini pill\" to regulate my menstral cycle. I suffer constant overstimulation, anxiety and panic attacks at work. I am left on long term sick. My doctor says I'm \"emotional unstable\" and depressed. He warns me that \" if I continue like this, things will spiral and get worse. No one will want to know me, no one will love me and I wont be able to get a job. I needs to snap out of it\". He prescribed antidepressants (cypralex) and refers me to a psychologist. The phycologist puts me in CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) . I'm diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, given Coping mechanisms and left to handle it alone. Nothing improves so I decide to stop all medication and connect with a councillor. My mood , relationship, eating habits, periods and sleep drastically improve.\n\nI'm 23 and I've been free from synthetic hormone contraception for over a year. I developed a gradual pain each month that feels like period pain but 100000x worse. I see a specialist in February and they tell me that I have a \"chocolate cyst\" in my left ovary and it will need surgery. They schedule the surgery for August of the same year. In that 6 Months the pain rapidly worsens. I got stiff and eventually can no longer stand up straight as somethitis pulling me into a fetal position. Whilst waiting for the surgery I'm giving ibuprofen to \"manage the pain\". When the surgery happens they find the cyst has.grom from a pea size to the size of an orange, wrapped around my fallopian tube and adhered to my bowel. The surgery take 6 hours, it's endometriosis and in removing everything they are forced to take half of my left ovary. They inform me thaty fertility will be extremely limited and that I must have a hormonal birth control IUD to prevent the endometriosis returning. I'm devastated.\n\nI'm 28, my mind is constantly racing, I'm over analytical, struggling with rejection and hyper fixating on many topics of interest. I speak to my doctor and request an ADHD and autism assessment. I'm placed on a waiting list. \nMy fiance a lnd I want to try for a baby, we have the IUD removed. I have blood work to test my iodine levels and they're worrying. I see a thyroid specialist who does an ultrasound and discovers I have Hashimotos disease. I'm given thyroxin meds and told I need to take them forever, but nothing more. two weeks later I'm pregnant. . \nThe first 7 months of pregnancy is hell, I have extreme morning sickness and cannot hold down food. I'm in and out of hospital for checks and IV fluids. They discover a new cyst growing on my left ovary and blocking my cervix. They're concerned I cannot give birth safely but will \"wait and see\".\nMy daughter is born early at 37 weeks, the labour is 14 hours long. I have so much damage that \"you'll need cosmetic surgery to fix this\".\n\n5 years go by and my mental state has worsened due to being a first time mum and covid preventing me from seeing my family. I start to notice ADHD and autism traits even more. My night terrors worsen, I'm given antipsychotics (quetapin) to help me sleep. I've been on the waiting list for an ADHD assessment and autism assessment for almost a decade. Eventually I decline enough to be sent to an mental clinic. The lead doctor believes ADHD and autism is a tiktok trend and I'm just depressed. After 6 weeks in the clinic, I'm sent home with a PTSD diagnosis and modern antidepressants. The psychologist from the clinic determines that I am neuro divergent but cannot precisely narrow it down. \n\nAnother year goes by and a male friend from the clinic contacts me to tell me he was told he might have autism whilst in the clinic and his doctor referred him to a colleague who just diagnosed him with autism. I ask for this doctor's number. A month later I'm assessed and diagnosed as autistic. The same level and severity as my brother who was diagnosed as a child and has never worked a day in his life due to being told he is unfit to work by rh social support team. At this point in I'm my late 30's \n\nI see a female psychiatrist who explains that based on my symptoms she believes I'm audhd and prescribed me ADHD meds (Elvanse). My crippling anxiety and chronic overthinking, instantly vanish. I feel so much better. I ween off of my \"modern antidepressants\" and I continue to improve. I have a lot more clarity and begin to look forward to things.\n\n4 months go by and my life has vastly improved. Yet my heart rate is continuing to be dangerously high. Never dropping below 90 and constantly in 130-150 range most of the day. Also, my joints hurt every morning and whenever I stand from crouching or sitting on the floor, I have a sharp pain in my head that radiates down the side of my face and jaw. The doctor does blood work and a heart monitor rest for 24hrs. The blood work is fine but they confirm the heart rate is high but \"they aren't too concerned\" and so nothing further happens. 2 months later and my joint pain has worsened and my weight loss is drastic. I push the doctor for more investigation into the cause of the heart rate, head pain and joint pain. They run more blood work and again it's normal. The doctor believes that it could be my bones weakened from the prolonged use of thyroid medication and Quintapin. I'm now waiting on an orthopedic specialist appointment.\n\n\nAll through my life I've been treated like a hormonal little girl and doctors either dismiss me of take the easy way out with generalised hormonal medication. Now, as I approach 40, the reality is I have multiple genetic conditions that have been ignored and misdiagnosed. Consequently I'm now facing damage and pain long term, all because doctors assumed everything was to do with my menstral cycle or hormones. Only after I argued and pushed did any investigations take place which finally identified the causes and not the symptoms.\nI have been failed by the healthcare system of two different countries all because I'm a woman.",

We have a public health system that I had to go outside of to get that diagnosis. ADHD was diagnosed but not medicated for 3 years because it was \"only inattentive\" and wouldn't affect her. Medication was not advised because it wouldn't help and you don't want her on meds. Plus they decided I was mednseeking. She couldn't have ASD either because she can make eye contact.....\n\nMy son. 1 trip to the GP, I think he has ADHD for the following reasons. I expected a fight to get him seen. No. GP agreed with me, referred him immediately. 3 weeks later we were sitting in the pysch nurses office doing an intake interview, she said he's likely ASD not ADHD, pushed us through to the doctor. 2 weeks later we walked out with a formal diagnosis of ADHD, informal ASD and a prescription for ADHD meds. \n\nThese are the same people who suggested my daughter had friends/boyfriend issues and maybe it was her period or hormones but they wouldn't medicate her. 3 appts in 5 weeks for my son and meds immediately. \n\nAnd they wonder why women are mad and push so hard for our daughters!\n\nETA: when my kids were diagnosed their doctors told me to get tested for ASD too.

I have to speak to the doctor that put me on antidepressants when I first mentioned how bad the pain gets between and during my cycle.

    "selftext": "Left a 25 year relationship yesterday. Took a bit to realize the man did nothing but use me. The story is longer than that, but nothing I necessarily want to detail or go over right now. It's too raw, and, if I'm being honest, too fucking embarrassing. I'm so angry at myself for so many reasons - mostly because I'm not stupid, very far from it, but I let myself be stupid for my whole fucking adult life and now I'm 40, with 5 kids and nothing to my name. It's a bitter fucking pill to swallow. \n\nMy 17 yo daughter and I went to the store on the way to my mom's, where we are staying. My daughter is also not stupid. She's seen this coming for some time, and knows and understands the reasons why. She is in full support of me, and only wishes I had done it sooner. The plan was spaghetti, but not fully homemade, we were looking at jarred sauce and she could see that i was overwhelmed. She said, \"what kind do we normally get?\" I say, \"Ragu...but honestly Kiddo, only because that is your dad's preference.\"\n\nShe pauses, and says, \"well, what do YOU like, Mom?\"\n\nMan, that question hit me between the eyes hard. I've spent these years catering to him and his tastes, totalling putting myself behind him at every turn, and having the freedom to make my own calls based on my own taste should have been freeing - it should have been empowering. I should have giggled and danced and picked out MY favorite while mentally giving him the finger. I'm not being dramatic when I say, it's never been my choice. It's always been keeping the peace, making sure he is comfortable and happy, so he doesn't yell, or throw things, or pout and ignore me for days because I brought home the wrong ketchup brand.\n\nInstead, I realized - I had no fucking clue. None. Zero. What do I like? Of anything?? Am I going to have a goddamn existential crisis every time I have to choose between what I always get because he required it, and what I want?? \n\nI haven't been gone 24 hours. I know this gets better. I know I'll be able to giggle and dance over my own choice at some point. I know it's too close to really truly understand my freedom, and relish it. I will not go back, so I will have to relearn myself. \n\nSo my question you all is - if you've been here, what are your tips for getting through the initial shock of realizing you know nothing about yourself, and how did you find her? \n\nEdit: This community never fails to amaze me. I love you all. Like, seriously love you. Today is ending a lot better than yesterday, and a good piece of that is because of you all, and the support provided. My very sad and tired being feels rejuvenated by the kindness and grace, and every single piece of advice has been noted and will be utilized. \n\nI can breathe, and I can (and will) do this. \n\n2nd edit:  Bah, I forgot in my first edit! I picked Rao's. Was good, but will go back to the homemade sauce my dad and I used to make ❤️",

In short,  EVERY decision needed to be \"safe\" on a lot of levels.  \n\nOne day,  I'm in Sears.  And I FELL. IN. LOVE.  with a purse.  It was a bit expensive.  I only got myself clearance stuff and this wasn't even on sale!  It must have been...I don't know,  50 bucks in today's money.  It was a pastel rainbow in sisal.  It was a bucket style with a single snap closure.  \n\nI was always taught a bag should only be brown,  white,  black,  or navy, so it would go with almost anything.  It should have at least a flap and maybe a zipper, for security.  This bag was Forbidden.  It had a distinct style that looks great with summer wear,  but not so great with office wear.  And I could hear my mom and three sisters expressing disapproval in my head.  \n\nI wandered that store for a half hour,  trying to talk myself out of it before I realized.   It's JUST a purse!  It's a small splurge,  and it's ridiculous that I'm standing here arguing with people in my head over this Thing!  \n\nI bought the purse.  I took it home and started using it,  told my family I loved it.  Not one of them criticized me.  And within six months,  every one of my sisters,  AND my mom,  had purses that were a novel color,  or style,  or shape,  or all three.  And I didn't say anything either.  I just kept breaking the family fashion rules.  Sometimes  I didn't like the results,  but at least I now knew that!\n\nI get the existential crisis of spaghetti sauce,  and purses,  and how long your hair should be,  and everything.  Break some rules.  Try stuff.  Fail a little bit.  It's not failure; it's exploration, and you are always going to feel a bit awkward when you're outside of your comfort zone.  But it only grows when we push it.  So try some Rao and Classico and Prego, and making your own.  Throw a few things into your cart you've never tried.  And find yourself something amazing that reminds you that you are NOT bound by all the rules you've lived by.  That purse was my symbol of independence, and every day when I saw it,  I knew l could make my own choices as long as nobody was harmed by them.",

    "selftext": "Long story short, I’ve changed my birth control and few times over the past recent years.  In January I got my mirena removed (hormonal iud) because it gave me such bad anxiety and palpitations, I was having panic attacks nearly every day. I had it in for 14 months so I really did try but it never settled, in fact it got worse. \n\nI decided to just go back on the pill after already trying the copper iud. This was 3 months ago and Oh. My. God. I thought ‘oh 3 months my mood will stabilise’ WRONG it’s gotten worse. And I’ve put all of the responsibility of making me feel better onto my partner. I’m acting insane and I feel insane. He has now just given up, he says he hates living with me and he has to leave. \n\nI know it’s me and my own fault because how I acted where my own choices but I can’t help but feel like the pill (I was on Yasmin btw) just absolutely ruined it for me. \n\nI can’t prove this to him, I’ve always been an emotional person, just not anywhere near this extent. So he doesn’t believe that that is what’s changed. Maybe it isn’t, maybe I just wasn’t a very good person. \n\nWe also only recently moved in with each other, about 6 months ago. So it’s hard to say that this is the sole cause. But I feel like a completely different person. Ive been tracking my moods for the last 3 months and they’ve just declined as time went on. \n\nBut I feel empty right now. I know I’m not continuing the pill, it’s already in the bin. But it’s too late for that now so I’m done. \n\nETA: my partner said this all to me only a few hours ago, there was an emotional episode on my part and he couldn’t take it anymore (completely fair and understandable, I really don’t blame him) so I’m turning to you lot to chat to and set my head straight.  \n\nSecond ETA: I’m aware this is coming across as anti BC propaganda, this is definitely not my intent! I’ve struggled to find a birth control that works for me but that doesn’t mean that they’re all terrible, it’s not one size fits all and I know for lots of women Yasmin is great for them, just like the mirena can be great for other women. I’m not discrediting any of that. This is just an honest recount of my experience and I am not here to deter anyone away. Birth control can be a great thing and it has helped many women, don’t let this one post about my personal experience change your opinion. While I believe Yasmin flipped a switch inside of me - it was ME that ruined the relationship. I was the one that didn’t take control of my moods, I didn’t control my reactions correctly and I took no responsibility for how they were impacting others. I am taking full\nownership of that! ",

That shit is hard.\n\n✅Local elections matter still. \n\n^Lol I think (at least) \n\nvote, volunteer, organize. Way too many gen z & millennials who had everything to say on TT sat it out. That 10 min early voting time is nothing compared to what women went through for the suffragettes movement. We got this.\n\n✅ Support legal fights ACLU, Planned Parenthood, grassroots orgs. \n\nAlso, Courts. Congress. If they aren't doing shit why are they even there? \n\n\n✅ Pressure corporations. Write to them (I wrote to Amazon and cited my spending over the last decade) 🤢 profits are at risk and they should know exactly why you stopped spending so they can't just blame the economy. \n\nEspecially love it if they supported trump's ascent. \n\nThey should know that *you know what they did last summer* and your money doesn't support fascism any longer and never knowingly did.\n\n✅ start prepping. I'm not talking doomsday but it's probably not going to hurt to start buying a few things in bulk from your local store that still supports DEI and gave Trump the ..|., Rice, beans, tools, you know, just in case. Worst case scenario: you have some excess for natural disasters and other emergencies.\n\nPrepping also means finding out about how new legislation impacts your right or ability to vote.\n\n✅ use gender affirming pronouns. It matters. Especially now. Trans women (and men) are feeling isolated and it's not right.\n\n☑️ if you're an ally in any level of power you can act. If you're a medical care professional you've an ethical duty to at minimum get your patients information so they know where to go (if you're in the know).\n\nGoes without saying it isn't just about women's rights. Far too often people only care when it directly impacts them. BIPOC, LGBTQI+, the Hispanic communities, trans men, gender non-conforming as collective we're strong. WOC way too often have been looked to as if they should be the saviours despite being one of the most marginalized groups. Don't leave this for them to have to solve because it'll impact them the most.\n\nTake care of yourself too. Tomorrow I'm going to go touch grass. Grow things. Think of positive stuff. And Monday there are protests. Maybe I'll see you at one. Stay safe! Stay informed! Stay positive!",

I also had shoulder surgery a week later,  because if you're going to be miserable,  you might as well be all the way miserable and get it out of the way.   I knew going in I'd need that week for my abs to recover a bit. You use shoulders and abs a lot more than you think, and having them both under renovation at the same time was rough.  \n\nA belly binder helps a bunch at first,  to ease pain.  Rest.  No, more.  MORE, damn it!  That's major surgery.  Don't try to paint the last little bit of the house,  like me, just because it's going to rain.  Make sure you have stool softeners and eat a diet to keep things loose.  The first stage of recovery is quick,  but you will be tired if you get up to much for weeks,  and if you don't pay attention to it,  you'll feel worse longer.  That said,  get up and walk a little a few times a day,  going further each time.  You DO need exercise,  but not much of it. \n\nMy libido woke up and roared about four weeks after surgery.  It was two more before I could do a think about it. I had some dryness, which we used Replens for.  That stopped after a bit.  For a while,  the libido also died back.  In my case,  I was fully surgically menopausal. I ended up going on hormone patches,  which saved my libido from joining my organs in the afterlife.  I was able to stop those after a bit, and then the picture gets fuzzy.  I may have lost and retained libido between then and now because menopause,  or because extreme stress, or the cancer that was quietly growing in my stomach and liver.  Who can say? But anyway, it's back.  \n\nMy vagina is maybe a bit shallow,  but I think it always was.  Sometimes I have to ask my husband to ease up because hitting the end of the road becomes uncomfortable over time.  But that was an issue before,  too. \n\nGood luck.

    "selftext": "At least twice a month, almost every month, for the last ten months, I’ve been struck down with extremely painful headaches. \n\nYou may be thinking migraine, but there is never any aura or sensitivity to sound or light and, actually, they tick several boxes for cluster headaches in terms of the type of pain felt, the location, the timing, how it makes me react, etc. \n\nI should’ve gone to the GP long before this, I know, but there’s a reason I didn’t: I’m on the combined pill. Every single time in the last decade that I have gone to my doctors/nurses with any issue, no matter how unrelated, I am pushed to change to a different method of birth control. \n\nYesterday was no different. \n\nFresh out of an episode, where my pain frequently reaches an 8/10, I am told my birth control is causing hormonal migraines, and I will not be given any form of pain relief unless I come off the combined pill, as it would be ‘unjustifiable’(?!). I’m aware that the combined pill + migraines w/ aura = increased risk of blood clots or stroke, but I truly believe I am not having migraines, and certainly not ones with aura, anyway…\n\n“You should get the coil, and while we’re putting that in, we can get your smear done too! Bob’s your uncle!” That is a direct quote, folks…\n\nI’ve let them talk me into trying other contraceptive options for brief periods in the past, and the combined pill is the only one that doesn’t turn me into a spotty, sweaty, suicidal rage monster - and it has the added benefit of being able to completely skip bleeds, which I frequently do. Why now, after being on it for over a decade, would it suddenly start making me feel like I’ve got a needle being jammed into my eye socket?\n\nTo top it all off, I read the post-appointment notes online. She’s saying our appointment took a very long time and ended with me declining pain relief options. All I did was answer her questions, she derailed the appointment by trying to force me to switch, and I ‘declined’ what was offered because it was only offered on the condition that I immediately stop the combined pill and get a coil inserted! No time to research, or think, or adjust, just stop and switch. \n\nI know I should be thankful, because at least I’ve got birth control options, I’m just so tired of having to explain and beg and fight to be taken seriously at every single appointment. In 2-3 weeks’ time, I will have to endure excruciating pain once again, with no form of relief, all because I wouldn’t let them screw around with my hormones again. \n\nEDIT: Thank you for the advice and support. I’m in the UK, which limits what actions I can take compared to our American sisters. That said, I will be asking for a second appointment and thus a second opinion, and I will be taking notes with me! I won’t get my hopes up though - appointments are only supposed to be 10 minutes long, and it takes about that amount of time to parse out a history and symptoms, without having to try and justify other issues…",

I told her I have regular periods, although they last for 6-7 days and are extremely painful, to the point I NEED to take very strong medicine when it starts and if I don't or when I take it when the pain is already there it's too late. It hurts so much I can't do anything, I just lay on the bed or on the floor for 2 hours, breathe deeply and wait. Recently I discovered the 1-10 pain scale with descriptions which pain is what number, easily my period pain is 8-10. Every month.\n\nSo I told the doctor about this and also said that I've been to another doctor (different specialization) with another issue and have been told that my symptoms could be caused by endometriosis and I should have that checked. So I asked if she could perform whatever tests are needed. She looked at me very annoyed and asked if my periods are regular, I said YES BUT THEY'RE PAINFUL AS I ALREADY SAID. Told me she doesn't know any tests regarding endometriosis except for MRI and that I probably don't have it if my periods are okay LMAO. And then said \"PREGNANCY HEALS ENDOMETRIOSIS YOU KNOW\". My jaw was on the floor.\n\nShe prescribed me some painkillers and told me to come back in 6 months if periods are still painful. I told her 4 times that they've been super painful my whole life and for the last several years it's getting worse and worse!!! And she totally ignored everything, I'm so angry I want to cry. Of course I reported her, but I'm feeling so humiliated and neglected, I don't know how to find a gyno who will actually listen to me.\n\nEdit: thank you for all the replies!!! Oh if I could print it out and throw it at that doctor, that would make my day lol.\n\nIf you want to laugh some more, I mentioned to her that last year I had deep vein thrombosis. Which was treated and cured within few months. She started YELLING at me that I didn't say that the moment I stepped into her office, that I can't take this and that birth control if I had DVT etc etc. (I've never been on the pill and I didn't even ask her for birth control prescription) And when I mentioned endometriosis she did say that she COULD give me birth control that is LESS LIKELY to cause blood clots. Wonderful isn't it? I mean, who wouldn't love to take a gamble? Will I get DVT again, will it be this month or next? Will I die from it this time? Who knows!",

They're out there, don't give up.\n\nIt seems like you already know this, but pregnancy absolutely does not heal endometriosis by any means. In fact, women with endometriosis often struggle to conceive. What's more, an MRI is not the only test for endometriosis. The best test is the laproscopic insertion of a camera into the area. This is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, and is part of the reason endometriosis takes, on average, 12 years to diagnose. Doctors are hesitant to order this test because it is invasive and costly.\n\nThe other thing many medical professionals won't admit to you is that they are just not knowledgeable enough about endometriosis. So, on top of doctor shopping, YOU have to be. Do as much research as possible. Document your symptoms extensively. Create a binder with all your tracked symptoms and research into diagnostic procedures and treatments and go to appointments armed with it to argue your case. \n\nIf a doctor refuses to order any disgnostic tests for you, tell them that you want it documented in your chart in front of you that they are refusing to order and tests or treatment despite your ongoing symptoms. This will often make them reconsider.\n\nKeep fighting. Periods are not supposed to hurt. You deserve treatment. Have the entitlement of a man about this. You are entitled to healthcare and a pain-free life.",

    "selftext": "Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my native language. \nI am Spanish, where abortion is legal and you don't need any excuse to have an abortion. Your decision alone is enough. Nobody asks you for explanations. Only some health workers tell you that You should be more careful with the contraceptive method. \n\nTen years ago, when I was 19, I had an abortion. I want to share my experience. \n\nAs soon as I found out I was pregnant, I called to schedule an appointment to have an abortion. When I arrived at the health center, they performed the ultrasound. They gave me a mandatory 1 week of time to think about it, and then They gave me the appointment for the abortion. \n\nWhen the day of the appointment came, I went to have an abortion. To my surprise, the doctors decided to give me an abortion with pills. I refused instantly. Despite my youth,I knew that this would cause me labor-like pains for hours. And that was exactly what I wanted to avoid. After struggling a bit, and the doctor putting up obstacles, I got my surgical abortion. \n\nIt was all so easy with the surgical abortion. They gave me a pill that just made me very cold. Then they gave me an injection in the lower part of my back, This caused me a lot of pain, almost like childbirth, but the pain only lasted 3 minutes. \n\nLater I went to the operating room, where the doctor removed the fetus using aspiration. \n\nNo pain, no complications. The operation took about 8 minutes. After that, they told me that I had to put on a very thick pad because I was going to bleed a lot. That wasn't the case. I barely bled. \n\nAs soon as I left the clinic, an hour later I stopped bleeding. The bleeding was less than that of a period. \n\nI had no pain afterwards. And to my surprise, 1 hour after the operation I felt fine, and I was already running and eating at Foster's. \n\nIt was the best decision of my life. It gave me 10 years of incredible happiness and experiences that I would not have had if I had a child. Besides that, abortion had something very positive for me. \n\nBefore, my periods were incredibly painful. After the abortion, I don't have any pain during my periods. \n\nNow I'm going to undergo another abortion, 100% legal and completely free. This time they completely ruled out the pills because the pregnancy is advanced, and the only possible abortion is surgical. \n\nI just wanted to share this, because I'm glad I live in a country where this can happen. \n\nI am very sorry about the situation in the United States, it is totally inhumane. \n\nMy reasons for having an abortion may be selfish. \nI hate children, and I'm terrified of pregnancy and childbirth. \n\nSince I was 9 years old I knew I would never give birth to a baby. \n\nI send a lot of strength to the women of the United States who are prohibited from having abortions. \n\nNo one, absolutely no one, has rights over your body.

    "selftext": "I thought I was hollow enough inside that it wouldn’t hurt. 24 hours, 48 hours… it feels like I’m slowly cracking open inside and letting the hurt and recognition in. \n\nMy husband of over a decade just confessed that he was sexting and sending nudes to someone online. He said it was because he was lonely, because our marriage has been rocky. He said he fucked up and they are now blackmailing him, but he hadn’t sent money. The blackmailer knew who I was, his family. I’m not sure what else. I’m not sure what to fear with this. How to protect myself from the information they may have stolen. \n\nI was so shocked by his confession, but at the same time, so hollow. I couldn’t really feel anything other than shock. No anger, no sadness. Now, 72 hours later I’m reeling. I’m putting pieces together I otherwise might have overlooked. The small blue tear dropped shaped pill my son found on the floor a few nights ago, was not candy (hastily taken and tossed out before I could look closer at what I thought was print on the pill), but viagra. The car that hasn’t been cleaned since he bought it ten years ago, is suddenly detailed, as if to impress someone. He said he’s going out and trying to find hobbies that make him happy, but he leaves in the middle of the day to go to the movies or hikes or breakfast, alone. \n\nIs it more than this online affair? I can’t ever trust him again to find out. There’s enough signs and evidence to say that he has physically cheated, and enough trust broken for me not to care if there is more. \n\nI can’t say I’m blindsided, because there have been signs, if I wanted to look closer. But I made my feelings on cheating clear. I loathe cheating. It is cowardice. It is a core belief of mine, that I would never cheat and never stick around with a cheater. \n\nNow I have to figure out how badly we may have been damaged by this blackmailer, and what I can do to pick up the pieces. I have to tell him to leave, figure out how to tell the kids and then figure out how custody will work with our chaotic work schedules. I have to learn how I can afford everything on my own, what I can keep and what I have to sell. What hobbies I can continue and the ones I have to give up. I’ve given up so much of my life for him. Around him, I’ve cowered and caved. I’ve given up years to his anger and selfishness. \n\nI was willing to keep trying for the kids. But I can’t even stand the sight of him right now. I’m at such a loss. it was so good do a few years and slowly rotted from the inside for so many more. \n\nEdit: because someone was insinuating that this could be partially/ my fault for a “dead bedroom” situation, i wanted to clarify. I rounded up, it’s probably closer to 6-8 months of no intimacy, with agreed upon terms to work out our marriage and mostly work on ourselves so we find the person we were before life crushed us, or figure who we are now. The bedroom has been difficult but not dead until I suggested this situation. I wanted to see if we could uncover our feelings from the ground up because it was amazing once. Otherwise, a lot of intimate moments feel like I have to, and not because I want to. That’s not fair to either of us. \n\nI can’t fit all the nuances of our relationship and its failings and the reasons I’ve held on for as long as I have, on here. This has been years of fighting and pushing, only to ultimately feel like I am crushed from the weight of his wants and needs, and unable to dig myself out. \n\nCheating, is not an acceptable excuse. Especially in this situation. Everyone is different, and I hold off judgment on anyone else, and what they are going through, but this man has had many opportunities to end it and chose the cowards way out. Either because he didn’t want to let me go, or because he didn’t want to be the one to end it. He chose to humiliate me and break my trust instead of ending it with dignity. This is what hurts the most. ",

It's definitely important to know where yours is coming from because that can help informing treatment options. \n\nHowever, personally, I don't think your tube surgery is causing the problems unless they cut where they shouldn't have. I can see two, maybe 3 possible scenarios:\n\n1) You said the pain started right after the surgery? In that case, there is a chance they have hurt something else. Especially with so much scar tissue, it can be hard to navigate anything down there. It's not even malicious and could have gone unnoticed. \n\n2) The remainders of the tubes, aka ovaries and the other end on the uterus, are sprouting more scar tissue. It can happen after surgery that new scar tissue is forming. If it is attaching to your uterus or maybe even attaching the uterus to other organs, it can be crazy painful\n\n3) Somewhat related to 2, your endo took a big turn for the worst. There is also the possibility of fibroids forming. If there is one inside, they won't be able to see it during a sterilisation. So it would make a lot of sense to get an updated ultrasound of you can. \n\nIn any case, please check with a doctor. Your tubes technically have nothing to do with your periods. That's the uterus' job. So whatever is going on there is related to it. I bet it on scar tissue attaching to it, as that's what has been Crippling me over the years. I am NOT a doctor, of course!",

She was also the kind of person to say \"I brought you into this world, I can take you out\" to her children. \n\nI have no desire to mourn her, and nor does my husband. We have been NC for a number of years now. I know I am the enemy because as someone who has a decent set of parents who always showed their love, I showed him the love and support he never got from her. He is an incredible person, who has a tonne of trauma from his mother alone. He used to have a lot of respect and love for his father until he saw he was her enabler and never ever stopped her from going through with her destructive actions. He defended, shielded and enabled everything she ever did. Long story short and the last straw with any relationship was that we lost our house because of her, and he didn't stop it.\n\nAnyway, she had been hospitalised after a stroke over a year ago, and she was essentially in care. She bullied and manipulated FIL into signing her out of hospital and bring her home. Of course when she gets home, she gets everything she wants, and stops taking her pills and starts eating shit again.\n\nObviously as the title says, to no ones surprise, now she's dying. She's in palliative care, and has been given a week. From what we can tell from family we do speak to, FIL isn't coping, and is desperate to get through to my husband. He has flat out said no to any contact with his father. It has almost been confirmed his father wants him to forgive his mother before she dies.... Why he thinks this could happen is beyond me, but I suppose it the last action to serve her wants.  \n\nI fully support my husband in his decision for no contact, and to deny her any last wish from him.... but his mood is terrible. He is angry, not angry at me for clarity, he is just a dark cloud. I have suggested therapy, I have suggested myself as an intermediary for contact, I have suggested he just tell him to fuck off again. \n\nI have reached out to my brother in law to offer support, and my husband's uncle who has always been our favourite and biggest support has been messaging. I don't feel like I can reach out to my father in law, because MIL was particularly nasty to me, and he knew all about it and never stopped her. She hates me because I still haven't given her grandchildren, and well now she will die with none. \n\nI don't entirely know my intention in posting, just screaming into the void maybe? ",

I think it might help him too. He probably won't agree to try it the first or 15th time you ask.

They just want us to be happy.\n\nMy psychiatrist has never told me I shouldn’t have children, but she always reminds me that I need to be very careful when it comes to birth control, because if I somehow get pregnant, I’ll need to interrupt the pregnancy because of one of the meds I’m on.\n\nNow that you know a bit more about my situation, here’s what’s bothering me.\n\nFor the past couple of months, YouTube has been spamming me with videos about pregnancy, conception, the “dangers” of hormonal birth control, etc. I have NEVER watched a single video about this, and I do **not** want to.\n\nSeeing this makes me terrified of getting pregnant, because my messed-up brain finds weird patterns in everything and thinks, *“Oh, maybe this is a sign from the universe that I’m about to get pregnant.”* I’m so scared of it that my husband and I use condoms even though I’m on birth control pills.

    "title": "PSA: There is a lot of misinformation and fearmongering about IUDs, and IUD technology has changed a lot in the last 10-15 years. Please make sure you know your options. ",
    "selftext": "I was told, when I was a teenager (15ish years ago), that an IUD was a terrible idea for me because back then they only had the copper option, ParaGard, and one hormonal option, Mirena, which had a dose which would be inappropriate for my body type. I had no idea that they had so many different options now, because I never thought of bringing it back up with my doctor – in my head it was disqualified as an option and the matter was closed. However, a couple years ago I discovered that they had released more options with different dosages of hormones, and I got my first IUD. And there could be one that is right for you! \n\nI know there is a lot of fear around IUD insertion, and its true that insertion can be very painful for some women, especially with providers who do not give anesthesia. However, IUDs are a safe, reliable, low-risk option for birth control, especially for women in areas or situations where birth control is not readily available, or might not be readily available, in the next 4 years. Additionally, while IUD insertion can be challenging, removal is MUCH simpler, faster, and less painful so if your body doesn’t like it, any medical provider could take it out for you. \n\nSince getting my IUD, I only have period cramps a few days a year, and I don’t bleed anymore at all. I’ve all but forgotten that a period exists. I don’t have to remember a pill every day, bring them with me if I’ll be out when my alarm goes off, fight with insurance to get extra packs before vacation, etc. It’s absolutely life changing. If I had known that there was an IUD option compatible with my body, I would have gotten it YEARS ago. I just had no idea and doctors are terrible at proactively offering options. And yes, insertion sucked, and I had horrible cramping for the first 2-3 months after, but it’s a price I would pay again without a second thought. \n\nPlease, ask your provider if there are options that would work for you. (And ask them if they will provide anesthesia and if they don't as regular practice, request it [edit: demand it] for your insertion procedure.) The peace of mind that you can get, knowing that you don’t have to worry about remembering a pill every day, or forgetting to get a shot, or a condom breaking, etc. etc. It is SO worth it. I know that not everyone will have a provider willing to give them options now or have access to clinics who provide these types of services, but for those that do still have access – please don’t miss out on at least exploring this option. \n\nEdit: This is not intended to be dismissive of any women who have tried an IUD and had a bad experience with it, or who don't have current access. I know everyone has a different situation, but I hope it can at least apply to some people. \n\nEdit 2: Some people have been criticizing that this doesn't explain the risks. I am not a healthcare provider, just a consumer. All birth control options come with different risks, e.g. blood clots from pills, scarring from nexplanon implantation, etc. Please talk to your provider about the risks and benefits of each, and if you have an IUD, get it regularly checked on.

I was stunned and too shy. Now I'm in my 30s, I give less fucks and I'm meaner, so I asked, \"What is the actual question? Do you want to know if I have an intimate partner? If I have sex on a regular basis? If I cohabitate with a man?\" - \"I need to know if you sleep next to someone, and if that someone \\*snores\\*\" - finally, the actual question, okay. That I can answer. But what does it have to do with being married? Married people can sleep in different bedrooms, have or not have sex, snore or not snore. What in the 1950s??\n\n  \nAnyways, I won't be going to him for a second assessment, and it was just the beginning of the session, half of which, honestly, made sense, but the other half was everything you'd expect an incompetent doctor to ask. \"Would you like to lose weight? No, like, really?\", \"It could be all in your head\", \"During your at-home sleep assessment, you need to fall asleep at any cost, so grab however many pills you'd like to be knocked out (excuse me??)\". \n\nI absolutely love my GP, and I've met doctors that are life-savers, but this one seems like it belongs here, in silence and shame.

If you weigh 195 pounds or more, ella won't work as well.\n\nNo matter how much you weigh, getting certain IUDs as emergency contraception works within 120 hours (5 days) after having unprotected sex. This is the most effective type of emergency contraception. An IUD has to be put in by a doctor, nurse, or other health care provider.",

    "title": "PSA: get a hormone panel if you have adult acne, regardless of your weight! ",
    "selftext": "I recently discovered the cause of the skin problems that have been plaguing me for over a decade and wanted to share in case it helps other ladies suffering from demoralising skin issues. \n\nAs a teen, I never had pimples. Dry and eczema prone skin yes, but never a hint of acne. Unusually perfect skin for a teen.\n\nAs I got into my mid 20s, the problems started to emerge. I always seemed to have pimples on my cheekbones, which got worse around my period. I chalked it up to having tight and conjested pores and living in a high pollution city with terrible tap water. I have very fair skin and was in a high UV area, so retinol wasn't recommended. \n\nAs I reached my 30s, my cheeks recruited my chin to the party. The red marks show up brightly on my pale skin and took weeks to fade. I used foundation every day. \n\nBy my mid 30s, no more cheek acne - just lots of leftover post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation that's too deep to shift with topicals. I constantly had a few pimples around my chin and mouth, which got worse with my period, and often were associated with the chin hairs which seemed to get more and more numerous over the years and eventually required a daily scan and tweeze of a 2-3 strays (and often would get stuck under the skin) \n\nBut all the women in my family had a few chin hairs. I assumed the increase was due to age. My skin demoralised me but nothing much seemed to improve it.\n\nNow in my late 30s, I decided to freeze my eggs. The first step was a blood test and hormone panel. \"Good news\" I was told. \"You have excellent levels of AMH. Top centile for your age. By the way, you also have mild PCOS\"\n\nI was so shocked!!! It had literally never occurred to me that I might have PCOS, since I have none of the typical symptoms. I am thin. I have a low waist-hip ratio and carry very little abdominal fat. I don't have that much body hair and no visible hair in the sideburns or moustache area. Clockwork regular periods with ovulation. Low blood pressure and good insulin sensitivity. I don't have oily skin or thinning hair. The *only* other symptom of my PCOS besides the chin hair and acne was horrible PMS and occasional breakthrough bleeding 1-2 days before my period due to slightly insufficient progesterone, which I'd always put down to stress since it was correlated.\n\nI told my sister. She said she had it too. She's also slim and no issues with getting pregnant three times including at 37. Her only symptoms were a few chin hairs and occasionally irregular periods (no acne).\n\nSo the PSA: if you're suffering from adult acne, don't assume that it can't be PCOS just because you're not overweight or don't have irregular periods. Get a hormone panel! \n\nMy PCOS is mild and I don't need spironolactone or other hormone treatment (a progesterone containing contraceptive pill was an option). The doctor prescribed Eflornithine for the chin hair and recommended I take a high dose of vitamin D. Hoping I might finally be acne free for the first time in 13 years\n",

That’s not the choice we are making for various reasons that have nothing to do with him being unwilling. \n\nIf I go through with surgery, it’s because it’s my choice. \n\nHysterectomy is not on the table. Just a regular sterilization. \n\n\n\nOP:   \n\nOn my anon account as this is more than I want to share on my main. \n\nI’ve recently turned 44. My husband is 9 years younger than me (35). \n\nSince we met almost 15 years ago, he’s always said he never wanted kids. That has never changed, from when we got together 10 years ago, to getting married 6 years ago, to today. \n\nI wanted kids when I was younger. My first husband and I tried for years but only ended up with 3 early miscarriages. I was diagnosed with PCOS and there were concerns about my ability to carry a pregnancy given the miscarriages. \n\nOnce I hit my earlyish 30s that baby desire stopped. Too much heartbreak, a failing marriage, getting older, etc. I have lots of nieces and nephews and was also a nanny so I probably have more baby/child experience than a lot of parents. \n\nI have an appointment tomorrow to discuss birth control options. Currently we use condoms. I’d really like to not need to use them any more. My problem is that I only would consider a pill or sterilization- I do not want an IUD or shot or implant or anything else. But I’m also a type 2 diabetic and on a drug to control my blood sugar that would impact the efficacy of the pill. \n\nSo that leaves sterilization. My husband and I have talked about it and he wants me to do whatever I feel best about doing. But I’m still worried about it for some reason. It seems silly to worry I might regret doing it when I’m 44, perimenopausal, and don’t want kids - if I got pregnant tomorrow I would very seriously consider abortion, even though I’ve always thought I would never do that after my infertility struggles. I love the life my husband and I have, with the freedom and money and time to enjoy our life together. When we want, we have lots of children in our lives to spend time with, ranging in age from mid 20s to under 1 year! And I have goddaughters who are like my own daughters who have always been there to fill that role. \n\nHas anyone actually had this done in their 40s and regretted it later? If so, why?",

I am at a crossroads and need unbiased opinions and some real feedback and experiences. Here’s more info.\n\nI am a 35f and my fiancée is a 38m and we have been together for over 5 years. We were going to live a Childfree life or so we thought.\n\nI have severe endometriosis and adenomyosis and honestly never thought I could get pregnant. I was in the process of considering a hysterectomy with how much pain I was always in. Plusssssss…. I was on the pill. But after treating multiple utis, and other infections, I guess that counter acted the pill and I was shocked to find I was pregnant. I had always wanted kids but my fiancée did not- it’s part of why he got divorced from his first wife (not the main reason but part was she wanted kids asap and he did not). With me thinking it would be hard if not impossible to get pregnant, I was open to a child free life. Plus I had always said I wanted kids once they were older so this seemed like a not bad situation to be in to be DINKWADs.\n\nThis news has put me in a stalemate. Once I saw the positive test, I’ve been struggling to abort. Im pro choice but always said to my fiancée- if I accidentally get pregnant, we are keeping it cuz I don’t think I could abort it.\n\nI’m coming up on week 11 so my time for a MA is running out and I live in a red state so I would have to travel to do a SA. We live far from family, at least a few hour plane ride away. We have no village. We have only been living in our location for a year and a half and we both work demanding jobs and are higher up in the corporate world and are both ambitious career wise. Financially we could afford a child, it wouldn’t be ideal but we could. We would have to start daycare at 4 months and I work 9-6 (get home 7) and he works 9-5 (gets home 530). We live in a rented 2/2 1000sq ft apt with two dogs. So it’s tight.\n\nI’m struggling to choose what path to go. My fiancée obviously doesn’t want a child but said he will be there and will be a great dad if that’s the cards we are dealt even tho he’s not happy about it. He’s not going anywhere. But I have guilt making that choice for him. And he does not want me to get an abortion for “him”. I’m scared to abort and regret and constantly wonder about the what if.\n\nBut I also love my alone and quiet time and the ability to decompress in silence. Sleeping in, traveling, doing whatever I want when I want are things I cherish. But that being said…\n\nI know I’ll be a great mom. I always saw myself as a mom but I’m struggling to accept we won’t be able to do what we want, whenever we want and will lose our freedom. I just don’t know if I could live with the guilt of having an abortion. Esp since I always said I wouldn’t. But then part of me has come to like and accept the DINK life!\n\nI feel split down the middle. I know it’s a girl and have started thinking of names and telling close family. I already feel love. But each day I go back and forth on what to do. My fiancée isn’t helpful with a decision because it “has to come from me”. I guess I am just looking for thoughts on based what you know here, what do you think I should do? Should I have or abort.\n\nWhat are you experiences?? Please help, I’m driving myself crazy with anxiety and needing to make a choice soon. Thank you.",

If you do decide to keep it, you need to come up with plans to care for you and your baby as if you were a single mom. Postpartum changes you and by extension the relationship, even when both parties want the baby. \n\nGood luck! ",

You’ve thought about names, you’ve imagined being a mom, and you’ve said you don’t know if you could live with the guilt of an abortion. That tells me that part of you does want to keep the baby, even if the practical and relationship side feels impossible.\n\nAt the same time, your fiancé has been very clear that he doesn’t want children, and the two of you have built a life around that. Raising a child without both partners being fully on board is incredibly hard, and it would mean facing a lot of challenges on your own. That’s important to weigh up, too.\n\nI don’t think there is a right or wrong choice here. What matters is which one you can live with in the long term, not just in this moment. It might help to set aside what your fiancé wants for a moment and really ask yourself what you can carry in your heart five or ten years from now.\n\nWhatever you decide, it should be the decision that brings you the most peace with yourself.",

    "selftext": "so i'm a 26F and i've yet to have penetrative sex. no reason in particular necessarily, just hasn't ever been the right circumstances. i'm now thanking fucking god that i never did. \n\ni went to the gynecologist yesterday for my annual visit. for context, i haven't been to see her in person since 2021 because of various reasons, so i have still never had a pap smear (until yesterday). i likely would have done it years ago but since i didn't see her, it didn't happen. she asked if i'd like to just get it out of the way this time and i said yes - mainly because i've had this running joke with my girl friends that i'm convinced i won't ever be able to have sex because nothing will fit inside me. i've tried using tampons a couple times in the past but it just really never worked, it was way too uncomfortable and i never wound up putting them all the way in. i've tried using sex toys, and same thing. always just extremely uncomfortable. i just chalked that up to being really tight and inexperienced and never thought too much about it. \n\nso i say yes to the pap smear and right off the bat it is not going well. the speculum wouldn't fully go in so she just started with a finger and Holy Hell when i tell you we both had the same reaction at the same time when she got far enough in, i swear i saw the light for a second. it was so fucking uncomfortable and i had a second where i was like \"damn i guess this is just what this is supposed to feel like the first few times\" but then i saw her face and realized that i was experiencing an abnormal amount of discomfort. \n\nshe starts to say that basically my hymen is really thick and that, in fact, nothing ***will*** fit inside me without causing an insurmountable amount of pain. by this point i feel myself about to faint and wind up almost fully losing consciousness and throwing up while i'm sat naked in the chair as my body's reaction to how fucking awful the sensation was. i actually cannot fucking imagine what would have happened if i tried to have penetrative sex before learning this. i think i would have easily vomited everywhere and most likely fainted if anything larger went in for any longer amount of time. probably would have been a funny story one day after a couple decades of therapy. anyway, the doctor starts telling me about how simple and easy and safe the surgery would be to fix this, and how afterward i could use tampons and have sex freely and without issue or threat of puking. \n\nwe didn't get a chance to talk about it any more than that because by then i was just not with it anymore, so i have a telehealth appointment set up with her for 3 weeks from now. one of the things i'm still unsure of is what the situation actually is with my hymen. i was looking it up and know that there are things like septate hymen, microperforate, etc., but idk what mine would be classified as. \n\nanyway, i've just been kind of going up and down the emotional rollercoaster since yesterday with this new information. it really confirms a lot of my suspicions and affirms my experiences and my concerns which does feel like a huge relief that i know what's going on, but at the same time i feel a bit in shock that there is actually something that is physically preventing me from having any comfortable experience. i also feel really fucking excited about the prospect of this surgery knowing that i could feel so much more free on the other side of it, but then at the same time i'm feeling that rational bit of dread that comes with learning you have to be sedated while someone takes scissors to your vagina. \n\n**i'm mainly looking to talk to anyone else who has experienced this**, all of my friends and my mom were shocked when i told them about it so i'm really curious about other's experiences. it's just a bit of a weird pill to swallow that i'm being medically advised not to have sex until i get surgery. \n\nall in all, a weird fucking trip to the gyno.

It literally would not go in. I was convinced that a rape would have literally destroyed me internally.\n\nEventually it became a genuine concern that there was an anatomical issue (like a vaginal septum). I had an exam under anesthesia, during which an apparently very thick and vascular hymen with a relatively small opening, was discovered and removed. (Note: whether or not this exam happened was 100% up to me.) I woke up sore with a pad that developed a half-dollar sized area of blood. I'm eternally grateful that it wasn't during sex. Honestly I don't know how it would have happened consensually without some sort of other intervention, at the very least lidocaine. \n\nSome time in the next few months I was able to use a tampon. I had to be on my back with lube, so it was a bit longer before I could actually insert them out of the house. YMMV, I've only ever used OB tampons because they're small and my finger was more forgiving than an applicator. \n\nIt was a long road, but 15 years later (for unrelated reasons I just wasn't attempting sex for the vast majority of that time) I was able to have discomfort free sex. I was very surprised the first time I orgasmed from penetration, as it was the opposite of what I'd experienced for most of my life.",

    "selftext": "*spelling mistake in title: misogyny.\n\nI would love some advice. I (F) am a teacher at an all boys high school. I also happen to teach a male dominated subject (mechanics). I've been at this school for 5 years. I chose this school, as there were benefits offered that I really wanted at the time. \n\nAs you can imagine, I am surrounded by boys and men all day, every day.\n\nI am good at what I do. I get great results, I love the subject (a reason for wanting to teach it), and I hardly ever doubt my ability. I have 2 decades of teaching experience.\n\nBut I think I've reached my limit.\n\nI deal with constant low-level resistance. No matter how competent I am, it seems boys and men *still* cannot believe a woman works in a workshop, lol. The subtle (and not so subtle) misogyny from both students and staff is absolutely draining.\n\nWhen I started, I had the energy and passion for the subject, and I was happy to show that a woman can do this job well. I loved the idea that kids would learn from a competent woman, and that that might even reduce misogyny.\n\nBut now, I'm just tired. I've done my bit, but I cannot say that I think I've made much of a difference. And I don't think I'll ever get rid of the resistance either. \n\nSo, to my point. I've now been offered a different teaching job, at a mixed high school, no more mechanics, but also less academic stimulation. A bit of a 'step down', if you will. Not in pay, but in expertise. I like the idea of a calmer, easier job. But I'd say goodbye to my passion subject, and that's a hard pill to swallow. I was kind of proud to be a woman in this environment. It feels like failing, and giving in to the patriarchy? \n\nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes? \n\nHas anyone had to make a similar choice? \n\nEDIT: THANK YOU for your lovely comments! I really appreciate it. I feel quite isolated in my position as there are no other women in my team, so it's really lovely to be able to get your feedback.",

Sometimes, she'll purposely poke at my vulnerabilities to get attention. It's endlessly frustrating. \n\nThe worst part is realizing she's not the woman I idolized as a child. She's human, she's flawed, and she's woefully unprepared to address her own emotional disregulation. Part of it is her own childhood trauma, part is lack of a social network, and then add in some stubbornness. It doesn't make it okay, but sometimes it helps to understand why a person acts a certain way. \n\nMost importantly, I've realized that I'm not going to change her. This is the only version of her that I'll have. It's been helpful to set firm boundaries and give myself space away if there's too much negativity. I don't get upset or argue if she behaves poorly. It's not going to get anywhere or convince her to change. Grey rocking has been a super useful skill. \n\nI've come to accept that I'll never have a regular loving mother daughter relationship.

And she was extremely emotional, but didn't recognise that. She would believe she was acting and reacting rationally, because she wasn't actively shouting or rowing, but her words and actions were driven purely by her emotional response to things.\n\nMy own issues (undiagnosed ASD and cPTSD both from early childhood emotional trauma and the constant minor trauma of being autistic in a world that doesn't know and doesn't care) didn't help our relationship at all, and in no way is she 100% to blame for us basically having no emotional relationship for 20-30 years, but if she'd had even the slightest ability to sit with feeling bad, to look objectively at her own flaws and take responsibility for them, to not perceive simply not sharing the same opinion about something as literally actively negatively judging her, we possibly could have actually worked on it and gotten to properly know one another.\n\nAs it is, while I'll never truly know if I knew her or not, I absolutely know she did not know me in the slightest, despite insisting - even to my husband - that she knew me better than anyone, better than him, maybe even better than myself.\n\nShe had her opinion formed when I was a young child, and then when I started to become an independently-thinking adolescent didn't know how to cope with that (I had been a very compliant child who turned to mammy for everything), formed a different image of teenage/adolescent me - which wasn't even accurate, but how and ever - and then never changed that one ever again. And so everything out of my mouth was already pre-perceived, pre-filtered, through whatever veil she saw me through.\n\nI'm deeply sorry you're going through something that seems so similar, and I wish I had advice or suggestions, but I'm afraid I don't.\n\nMy mam died of Alzheimer's in 2018, but we hadn't been close - or at least she hadn't really known me and I'd given up trying to have an adult relationship with her - for years before then.

    "title": "Feeling Lost - is fatigue normal at 31?",
    "selftext": "Finally got a new PCP in January but still no answers.\nI have been the same weight for over 10 years with absolutely no calorie tracking or dieting, simply existing. Over a year ago when I turned 30 I randomly gained 20 lbs. I have tried two different apps (Noom + My Fitness Pal) and multiple TDEE calculators and all say I should be easily losing 1lb /week. I have barely lost 4lbs in over a year of actively trying to lose weight. I average 6k steps per day (anywhere up to 20k) and do kickboxing, horseback riding and am a dairy farmer (active) and also try to go to the regular gym when I can. \nBloodwork came back in normal ranges. Although I specifically asked, an indepth thyroid panel was not done only super basic one which gives only a single value.\nThe only other thing my PCP has done was agreed to look into sleep apnea as potential cause and so far ive take two at home sleep studies and now waiting to see specialist. I don't snore and I don't feel like I sleep poorly, but I want to rule it out.\nBesides the random weight gain and inability to lose weight, I have very little energy most days which is increasingly bothersome and mentally draining. The last few months my period is now very light (can basically get away with just using a liner only). I have been on hormonal bc pills since 18yo and I am absolutely not pregnant (haven't had a partner in over a year). I have no libido. Its summer here and I have found myself wanting to be warm?? I have a long commute and have been driving home with the windows open when its 90° + and am comfortable. My house has been anywhere from 72° - 78° and am not bothered. However sometimes I will wake up sweating if i dont wear socks to sleep, but not always. My skin has been dryer than normal. Is this just what happens when you turn 30? What is wrong with me? I have no idea what to push for any more at this point. Do I complain again to the PCP? Do I go back to the obgyn? Is this just my new \"normal\" ? Please help 🙏  also for what its worth, I absolutely am certain that I am neurodivergent but have not received formal diagnosis and am not on any medications. I am pretty comfortable in my life currently, no real stress. I also have been taking vitamin B, D3 and magnesium supplements for years. My diet is good, focus on higher protein and fiber and lower calorie. I don't drink any soda, caffeine, or alcohol, really only water. I don't eat fast food and cook basically all my meals (not take out). I do not and have never smoked anything or used any type of drugs.\n\nAny advice, feedback or similar stories appreciated! Thanks for reading 🌻 I am not looking for a diagnosis obviously, just some ideas from real life ladies who may have gone through the same thing so that I know which direction to turn and what to try next. I am still learning how to advocate for myself and trying to be more persistent because I truly believe something is not right.",

        "text": "How long have you been off the pill for? I came off in January after nearly 8 years on the pill (Yasmin) and my first luteal phase was pretty brutal, my mental health plummeted and I felt so low (and I’m generally not someone who struggles with their mental health!). At the time I didn’t realise that this was linked to my luteal phase, it was only with hindsight when I was feeling more like myself again that I put two and two together. I remember thinking that if every luteal phase is like this, I’m going back on the pill. Thankfully each luteal phase since then has been much easier - I still get a bit teary/irritable/lethargic around that time of the month, but that’s very common. I also struggle a bit with insomnia during my late luteal phase and the first couple of days of my period but again, this is pretty common - the rest of my cycle I generally sleep fine.\n\nMy skin isn’t as clear as it was on the pill but I’d describe it more as texture/congestion than full blown spots/acne, especially on my forehead - it’s just something I’ve learned to put up with and manage with skincare, although I’m still hoping it’ll improve with more time. My hair started shedding around 2 months after I came off the pill and that has probably been the hardest part for me. I was just thinking yesterday that thankfully the shedding seems to have slowed down a lot the last couple of weeks, but it lasted a good 6 months.\n\nMy cycles still aren’t what you’d call regular, although they never were before I went on the pill. I haven’t been ovulating until around day 28 most cycles - however I’ve had bloods done and the doctor said that everything looks normal, so this seems to be normal for me. I’d recommend tracking your cycles using BBT/ovulation tests/symptom tracking to get an idea of what’s normal for you.\n\nHang in there, it will get easier. Once you get to the 6 month mark, you should be feeling much more normal, if not before then. In the meantime, try to prioritise going to sleep early (although I appreciate this is difficult with insomnia), eating well and exercising regularly. And look into supplements that can support your body post-pill, as the pill is known to deplete certain nutrient levels.\n\nEdit: I’m 25, almost 26 for reference.",

But now a month has passed and I still feel no libido.\n\nHe doesn't try to force me into anything. He will ask often for something, at least, but is never mad at me for saying no and reassures me he loves me no matter what. I've never felt uncomfortable telling him no since he's very understanding. When I don't indulge, he will take some alone time to take care of himself. He hasn't told me that my lack of libido is an issue for him, but due to his high sex drive I can only imagine how uncomfortable or insecure he might be feeling about it without telling me.\n\nWhen we do have sex, it's amazing, but now it happens quite rarely.\n\nSo... anyone with a similar issue?

    "title": "Why Are We Blaming Women Because Men Are So Right-Leaning…",
    "selftext": "Holy fuck, I’m so frustrated right now so bear with me. \n\nWhy is it always on women ( and left-leaning people—but that’s a conversation for another day) to step back, to play nice, just so the other side doesn’t hate us? I’m so fucking sick of this.\n\nI've seen so many posts claiming that younger men, or men in general, are leaning further right because women somehow “pushed them” there.\n\nExcuse me?\n\nEven in the past, before women were speaking up like we are now, we were still treated like shit on the bottom of men’s shoes.\n\nNow, in a time when we finally have a voice and choose to use it, we’re the ones blamed for “villainizing” men.\n\nThe same way men have villainized women and minorities for decades—and still do in 2024.\n\nI get it—speaking out against one side, even if they’ve thrown so much negativity at you, can push them deeper into their toxic beliefs. But why is this logic only applied when it comes to men, and not to women? Why can’t people understand why women speak the way we do about men?\n\nPeople seem to get why men are so negative about women and drawn to red pill content—because women villainize them, right?\n\nBut when women are critical of men or engage in content that revolves around misandry, suddenly it’s incomprehensible? Why is it so hard to understand why a group that’s been oppressed for so long would have such harsh things to say about their oppressors?\n\nWhy does no one seem to care that men have also pushed women so far left? \n\nWhy doesn’t anyone stop to ask why we speak about men the way we do, or why we “villainize” them, just as they’ve always done to us?\n\nLike…If women stay silent, we’re criticized.\nIf we speak gently, it doesn’t work.\nIf we’re too direct, we’re accused of pushing men away.\n\nAnd let’s be real—the right has way more women than the left has men. There are far more women who hate other women than there are men who hate other men. That much is painfully obvious. \n\nAnd in my personal opinion, women are more likely to call out other women for hating on men…than men are to call out other men for hating on women. This is just from what I’VE seen.\n\nThen there’s the “you can’t fight fire with fire” argument. So what the fuck are we supposed to do? What are we supposed to do?\n\nThey’ve bashed and villainized women for ages, but now that we have a voice and speak up, it’s suddenly an issue? Now it’s mainly our faults men are investing in red pill content even though that’s been so many of their mindsets, even before the red pill stuff came to be so popular? \n\n“Y’all villainize men so much.” If yall can understand why men may villainize women, why is it so hard to understand why women are villainizing men as well? Two sides of the same coin. \n\nWhen we’re nice about it, nobody listens. But the second we push back, we’re branded as villains for daring to echo just a fraction of the negativity men have spewed about us since the beginning of time.\n\nI’m so fucking tired of it. Anything women do gets twisted, spun, and demonized, while society finds a way to make men look like the victims.\n\nEverything women try to do is somehow wrong. We can’t talk to men nicely, we can’t stay silent, we can’t speak assertively, and even when I’ve seen women attempt to create safe spaces for men, she’s mocked by them or they accuse her of some hidden agenda. It’s either that, or the safe space she made was just a safe space for misogyny. \n\nSo what are we—women, the ones who’ve been oppressed—supposed to do to appease our oppressors, just so they don’t hate us even more? I’m so frustrated.\n\nAnd yeah, I get that this causes division, but what could we possibly do to fix it? Society keeps expecting women to solve issues like this, to somehow undo the mess.\n\nPeople don’t seem to grasp how deeply women are villainized, because they’re stuck in this belief that men are always the ones being unfairly blamed. I can almost understand that mindset, and it may be true in some cases…but we’re constantly caught between a rock and a hard place—we have misogyny spit in our faces, and yet we’re the ones who have to back down to avoid pushing men further into women-hating circles. \n\nWhile men just get to continue their hatred because if we react in a way people don’t like, and men get more misogynistic because of it, we’re blamed. \n\nSorry for the long rant, but I had to let this out. Seeing so many people sympathize with one side while ignoring the other has me absolutely fed up.\n\nI even went back and altered some of the way I said certain things because I feel like people wouldn’t understand my rant like I want them too—I still feel like they won’t. Even with me trying to tune my aggressiveness down a bit. ",

Men have been pushed right, and part of that is that men aren't adjusting well to equality and they don't understand that their perceived \"hardship\" is the result of redistributing the hardship that was disproportionately and unfairly on everyone else. They think others are treated favorably because any loss of advantage feels like unfairness. Men needed others to keep being oppressed so that their path was easier than everyone else's.\n\nA good way of explaining this to men is to talk about sports. In the past, only white men competed in sports as black men were excluded in mainstream sports. After awhile, superstar black men were allowed in, but not better than average players. Only later did they allow an equal playing field where capability mattered more than skin color and superior black players tended to dominate some sports. White men dominated as long as better men were held back and excluded.\n\nNow that women are allowed into all domains of life, superior people are competing with average white men. They think the only reason people unlike them are edging them out is favoritism. They can't comprehend that the deck has been stacked in their favor and their angry about it. The right has great appeal to them because it is promising to put women back in their place.\n\nWe don't have to solve this mess. We just have to refuse to accept the status quo that conservatives will attempt to impose upon us. The best way to do that is to be independent, successful, and to form community and comraderie with other women to pull them up and support them. Men need women more than women need men. That is clear from all of the posts about men who cannot cope emotionally, physically, or logistically with daily life without women taking on the burden. It is clear from the fact that married men are happier and live longer than single men.\n\nBe your best self and mentor and support other women. Get a good education and a good job. Take care of yourself an others. That is what you need to do.",

There was cramping for a few minutes afterwards, worse than my usual cramps, but not intolerable.  For me it wasn’t really cervical pain any more than a PAP smear as much as the uterine cramping while it adjusted to its new inhabitant. If you’re worried about pain you can question your gyno about a cervical block and make sure to take Tylenol before and for a day (or a few) afterwards.

The first thing I realized was that they looked almost new (aside from some minor snags, which you could barely notice from afar) despite being almost two decades old. I tried them on and they felt silky and soft, I love how they drape and they make me feel good about myself compared to say, worn-out cotton with fading and a bunch of pills. I’m going to sleep in them tonight and see how it goes, but they’re only pants, I don’t have a matching top.\n\nI’m tempted to order myself a matching set. The reviews for the sets I’m looking at are good, but of course a lot of websites don’t post the bad reviews. However, multiple people online say that they’ve gotten very sweaty and uncomfortable due to the polyester. Outside of the website in fact I haven’t seen ANY good reviews, except for people modeling sets (not sponsored!) on Tik Tok but no discussion of how they actually feel to sleep in. They do look very cute though…\n\nThis said, is there anyone who actually likes these types of pajamas, to actually sleep in? If it turns out I only like sleeping in the pants, I can live with that too if I’d at least wear the shirt around the house sometimes. But I’m debating if it’s worth it. I’d just hate to be out the money if it turns out I don’t love them!",

    "title": "General message: Get a hormone test if you have acne, regardless of your weight!",
    "selftext": "I recently discovered the cause of the skin problems I've been struggling with for over a decade, and I wanted to share it for the benefit of other women who are struggling with frustrating skin issues.\n\nAs a teenager, I never had a breakout. While my skin is dry and eczema-prone, I never had any signs of acne. Unusually perfect, spot-free skin.\n\nAs I reached my mid-twenties, problems began to appear. I always had painful breakouts on my jawline and chin, which worsened around my period. I attributed this to tight, congested pores. My skin is very fair, and I lived in an area exposed to UV rays, so I avoided using retinol.\n\nAlso, as I continued, my cheeks became prominent on my chin. The red marks became more pronounced against my pale skin and took weeks to fade.  I used foundation daily.\n\nBy my late twenties, I no longer had acne on my chin and jawline—just a lot of residual inflammatory hyperpigmentation, too deep to be cleared by topical treatments. I had constant breakouts around my cheeks, which worsened with my menstrual cycle, increasing in number over the months, eventually requiring daily inspection and plucking of two or three stray hairs (which often stuck under the skin).\n\nBut all my friends had some chin hair. I thought the excess was due to aging. My skin was frustrating, but nothing seemed to improve it.\n\nIn my early thirties, I decided to freeze my eggs. The first step was a blood test and hormone testing. “Good news,” I was told. “Your AMH levels are excellent. In the top percentile for your age. By the way, you also have mild PCOS.”\n\nI was in shock!  It never occurred to me that I might have PCOS because I don't experience any of the typical symptoms. I'm slim. My waist-to-hip ratio is low, and I have very little belly fat. I have little body hair, and I don't notice any noticeable hair in my sideburns or mustache area. My menstrual cycles are regular and ovulate. My blood pressure is low, and my insulin sensitivity is good. My skin isn't oily or my hair is thin. The only other symptom of PCOS, besides my beard hair and acne, was troublesome premenstrual syndrome (PMS), occasional breakthrough bleeding a day or two before my period due to a slight progesterone deficiency, which I always attributed to stress because of its association with anxiety.\n\nI told my sister, and she said she had it too. She's also slim and has had no problems getting pregnant three times, including at age 37. Her only symptoms were some beard hair and occasional irregular periods (without acne).\n\n So, if you have adult acne, don't assume it can't be caused by PCOS just because you're not overweight or have irregular periods. Get your hormones tested!\n\nMy PCOS is mild, and I don't need spironolactone or any other hormone therapy (progesterone-based birth control pills were an option). My doctor prescribed eflornithine for my beard hair and recommended a high-dose vitamin D supplement. I'm finally going to be acne-free for the first time in 8 years.",

    "title": "‘Not all men’  and why we need to be meaner to all men",
    "selftext": "I see posts on here from other (young) women, about hating men and being unsure of the rationality or justification of this. \n\nI have a background in law, politics and research. This is a brief thesis on why we need to hate men more, why it is all men, and why the situation is more dire than any of them realise, or mostly care. Sorry for the length. \n\nSo. The very concept of masculinity is inherently about domination - of other men, but mostly of women. It is literally impossible to ‘go their own way’ with an identity that controls my behaviour, to manipulate, threaten, overpower me into submission. \n\n‘But 80% of the women get matches and only 10% of men…’ \n\nYou want to know what the equivalent is? Download Grindr. You’ll get heaps of matches!\n\nThey fundamentally do not care about me as a person, that is only secondary to how I look. Men/society have AGGRESSIVE vitriol if you dare to be unfuckable. Blue haired liberals? Feminazi???\n\nOh but rapists and misogynists? ‘Men going their own way’. It’s the ‘red pill’. They’re just ‘visual creatures’ but can’t visualise a shower, or respect for women as people. \n\nWhen men demand the disclaimer ‘not all men’ this is revisionist history happening in real time. A real feminist man, who loves the women in his life as actual people and not sex robots that do shit for him/provide social status, is not 3 years old and understands the context that it’s not all of them, but enough that it’s a problem for every single woman in human history. If I say I hate traffic I am not lighting every car I see on fire. It is enough cars that it is a problem. \n\nMake no mistake, what is happening now is a femcide. ‘Not all men’ is just one cog in the misogynist machine. It differs from other genocides as keeping us alive is crucial - for sex, babies, unpaid labour. For dominating. \n\nThere is a systematic process by which this insurmountable degree of cruelty becomes accessible and widespread enough to constitute genocide. I have broken down in four stages:\n\n1. Trivialise - make us a joke, and discredit us so nothing we say has credibility. Lesbians wanting same sex marriage and legal protections are ‘blue haired liberals’. Speaking up for yourself is now ‘Karen’. Now we are the ones looking bad, overly aggressive (even though we aren’t). A social justice ‘warrior’. \n\nMeanwhile, softening words for their regime. ‘The manosphere’. ‘The red pill’. Yuck. They inexplicably believe the Neanderthal blueprint Andrew Tate who has even less jawline than hair (but more human trafficking charges) has a point about women and it’s the feminists that are crazy/wrong…about women. \n\n2. Escalate. Universally negative experiences that elicit strong emotional reactions - for example, COVID. The woke mind virus. The male loneliness EPIDEMIC. Social justice warriors, literally the ethos that we should respect each other are the aggressors…the narrative is flipped. \n\n3. Next, corruption. It’s all a conspiracy! Values are all mixed up, and now they are destabilised further. Serious conversation about systemic abuse of women is ‘fake news’. Men are martyrs and women are on the ‘warpath’ or a ‘witchhunt’. Somehow they become martyrs, seeking refuge from the oppression of women who dye their hair blue and pass the Bechdel test.\n\nEverywhere the man points now, we are on the other end and so we are othered. They are the us, and we are the subhuman them. \n\n4. Finally….its a call to action. This is the last stage, an escalation to widespread violence. Remember when Trump one of their cult leaders warned in 2020 that it would be a ‘bloodbath’ if Biden won? Remember Jan 6th? Yea. \n\n‘Alpha male’ what makes one an alpha? ‘Breed’ ‘femoid’ - these are threats. As you all know already I am sure. \n\nCase study: consider the me too movement. Women particularly in Hollywood finally speaking out against powerful men who have abused women with impunity (and been celebrated by society regardless) for decades. \n\nThe ensuing backlash: ‘cancel culture’, flip that narrative back around again. The reversal of Roe v Wade. The Johnny Depp/Amber Heard case, an excuse for misogynists to mobilise and discredit Amber Heard as a stand in for all women:\n\n*False accusations ruin men’s lives. Your body, my choice. Politicians cater to feminists, they just want to manipulate men so they can have free dinner* (the makeup on my face costs more than dinner but good try).\n\nAs if we are fighting for supremacy. As if we are an alien race that is hostile to men just for being men, that need to be put in their place. When the opposite has always been true. \n\nIf you are a man, and you say ‘of course I want women to be equals and I respect them and shit but I hate the word feminist because crazy chicks take it too far’ then YES, yes I mean you. If you tell me IRL or online ‘not all men’, then yes you too. If you tell me/women you’re a feminist but not the boys, or ask what you can do and then not doing anything actually helpful (including shutting up), then you sir are part of the problem. \n\nIt will be obvious with the ones that are worth it. These men don’t need to hear they are the exception, and won’t make your SA about their own egos. You won’t need to say not all men, and they won’t say they’re a feminist like a dog that wants a treat. \n\n‘Not all men’ is more of the same revisionist shit just like Holocaust denial. A man that is worthy of being in your life knows that when you complain about traffic, you’re not setting every single car you see on fire. There are enough cars that it’s a fucking problem. \n\nMasculinity is the problem, it’s blindingly obvious. But men did not like the answer that feminism provided. How can they be going their own way, at our expense? Feminism is not a zero sum game…masculinity is. \n\nNot all of the Germans were Nazis. Most of them didn’t need be, for what happened to happen. \n\nThey want the benefits of the patriarchy more than they want us as women to thrive.  Thats the real red pill. \n\n",

I think they're 52mg, and opposed to Kyleena which is less. You might want to consider getting your Kyleena replaced with the slightly higher hormone level IUD so you can more likely get the benefits of no bleeding at all. I've personally benefitted a lot from being period free.\n\nI'd definitely get it checked out by a doctor if you're bleeding that much. You're pretty young still, only 21, and you're right that using condoms only will increase your risk of pregnancy a lot. If you're having a lot of sex, definitely don't go birth control free if you can avoid it. I know other people can feel strongly about hormonal birth control, but any kind of temperature test you might do for yourself just increases your chances of error and pregnancy so much, it's probably not worth the risk. \n\nGood luck!",

    "selftext": "TW Please: I am going to talk about failed abortion please do not read this if its a sensitive subject for you.\n\nThis has got to be about my 3rd post and everyone has sent me support and love that I very much need at this moment. I truly cant see how I am going to overcome this. I feel broken. This is what happened and its unfortunately not even close to being over.\n\nOn 12/17/24 I (28f) had gone into planned parenthood for a surgical procedure. I was not sedated. They said I was about 7 weeks. The procedure was traumatic and barbaric. They used now what i have realized is a d&e, when they should've performed a d&c. I bleed and am in excruciating pain after the fact.\n\nMonday, 12/23 comes around and my cramps are so bad, I leave work early to go to my regular OBGYN office. they do an ultrasound.. and surprise i still have a completely viable pregnancy. The ob gives me a list of centers for the second procedure. I call up PP fuming and they are not only rude (the office manager) they keep trying to dismiss me. well i wanted to know what they took since it wasnt the gestational sac - the doctor gets on the phone in a 3 way call with the manager and says that he must have taken a piece of my uterine lining. they kept apologizing to me and trying to get me to come back and I had enough.\n\nFast forward 12/28 I go to the ER because i have brown watery discharge that smells like hot garbage, and stinging pains in my abdomen. I have an endometritis. The ER doctor and staff were APPALLED at the lack of care from PP, and the doctor even recommended I get copies sent to my ob and to keep myself. For a second he was concerned I had an abscess or something that could potentially lead to sepsis. He said I basically have the best of the worst, not good by any stretch, but its a good thing I came when I did. He said the physician who performed at PP should have done a d&c, because d&e are reserved for late term abortions. HE called it malpractice. and im lucky this is all I got from it. He said as far as he understands the pregnancy is viable but i need to see my regular ob and speak with her. when i spoke to her 12/23, she said theres a chance after a failed abortion going through with the pregnancy could be dangerous for me and cause potential birth defects and serious health problems during development for what would become a baby.\n\non top of this, my boyfriend is completely against the idea of keeping it. he has been supportive of my health, but he doesnt want it and i know this. its making me look at him different. in fact my mother and best friend are both unequivocally mad at him and wont speak to him. I am not in the best financial spot to have a kid, and it would be extremely difficult. But he has a daughter from a previous relationship whose 5, i have no kids. and this is my experience with it im scarred for life. in fact, his kids mother is currently pregnant. and I have to hear about it non stop. she also flipped out on him when he said he couldnt have his daughter this coming friday, because of me and a medical emergency (2nd abortion) - and she made a big deal. like ok i guess you want us to take a 5 year old to an abortion clinic? I wanna tell her to mind her fucking business so badly but it would make things worse.\n\nso now i have to wait until tomorrow, to call my ob's office, who is on vacay. hopefully see another doc there, get there opinion about a 2nd termination, when why and how. im on a regimen of anti biotics for 10 days including a shot i got at the hospital last night, not including doxycycline cause SURPRISE thats the pill for this condition except im ALLERGIC TO IT! so now i have anxiety wondering if this shits gonna clear up at all. I have to also deal with work who told me I need to request a leave of absence, but because i barely know what the fuck is going on, its hard to give them exacts and everything.\n\nI thought i would be over things by now. I am so emotionally and physically exhausted.  I feel like a terrible fucking person because realistically, the infection has nothing to do with the pregnancy - it has to do with the jackass who failed the abortion. so, this thing is viable. some people cant have kids and i feel terrible terminating AGAIN. Dont get me wrong I am very pro choice. but thats the thing, i am not on the outside looking in, its me, and I dont know how to deal. I worked so hard to overcome my anxiety, anorexia, OCD, body dysmorphia and depression the last 12 years of my life and now I feel like i am taking enormous steps backwards. On top of this, I have to hide it from some of my family as they arent understanding. my brother and sister are treating me pretty rotten over this. My brother more so. hes 16, he doesnt and will never have a full scope of what i am going through, but he has shut me out. my sister has gone through an abortion before, and she tries to be understanding but she just gets so snotty and i dont know why. I feel broken and hopeless.\n\nIf you read this whole thing, or take the time to write a comment, thank you. this reddit has helped me immensely these last few weeks and im sure it will continue to do so.\n\n  \n**UPDATE**: My regular ob is out on vacay. so i had to speak with another doctor, the one on call, and she said the er doctor is completely wrong. she said because of my lack of fever, and because of my white blood cell count being normal, i dont have an infection. Mind you, i feel like i have one. been a kitty owner for 28 years and Ive never experienced this foul discharge and sharp shooting pains, and I have endo so thats saying something.she said i should be able to go through with the 2nd abortion. I dont feel comfortable. because of my insurance, it has to be a clinic, cant be a hospital they wont take me. I am going to try to get a second opinion. but this is ludicrous to say i have no infection. millions of people walk around with STDS, PID, HIV, Cancer, even covid with NO SYMPTOMS. Im on day 3 of anti biotics and still have the pains. correct me if im wrong, but once you have a fever, with sepsis, doesnt that mean its WAY TOO LATE?\n\nMoreover, Im still feeling incredibly guilty for trying to abort. I cant fight how I feel. although Im trying. i simply cannot afford a kid - but i feel like things can change to appease that. Now im afraid with the attempt, it could have serious health problems or a deformity. This waiting is worst. my mom and step dad keep referring to it as a baby, and i completely flipped out at them. i think thats saying something about my guilt. ",

Last year I went to a gynaecologist for the first time with my mom and they gave me birth control pills in hopes that it would help, I ended up never taking them because my mom is very against the whole idea of them as well as the long list of side effects that I could get if it didn't work out.\n\nI have an aunt who took birth control when she was younger and I asked her for her perspective and she said she regretted because she got really bad menopause symptoms whilst she was a teenager. I also used to live in a country where there was not much talk about women's reproductive health and only recently when I moved countries did I learn about all the different illnesses that women have. At this point I don't know what to do because I NEVER want to have children so I wouldn't care if I have to get something removed to relieve this chronic pain.

I'm tired of dealing with constant body dysmorphia, I get so depressed the week before my period. Every time without fail I've vomited and had nausea when I star menstruation. I'm at my wits end at this point and don't wanna move on.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your support and advice. I want to clear a few things up. 1) When I said BC gave my aunt menopause symptoms I mean when she told me about her experience I Googled her symptoms and it told me those were menopause symptoms, sorry if that confused you, 2) I plan on talking to my mom properly and asking her again to at least let me try.

My phone shat out on me the week that I made the post and couldn’t follow up until now (it was an alt and I lost the password, HELLA what I needed the week I was having a termination alone and my phone completely died).\n\nI’d like to tell you all my experience having my second medication abortion, so others know how it could be, and so other disabled people have a frame of reference from another disabled person, and frankly just to vent because this fucking sucked, guys. \n\nSo my first medication abortion was at 18, 12 years ago, and frankly it was pretty straight-forward. I was in the last week to be eligible for a medication abortion, took the first pill, took the second pill, had *mindbending* cramps, passed a bunch of clots, and it was done. I had some emotional turmoil bc I was 18 and did it while living with my parents and being unable to tell them anything. I just said I was having bad cramps and would be in and out of the bathroom. God, I wanna hug 8 year old me so fucking badly. She didn’t deserve to do that by herself, and being so uneducated and unsure.\n\nI made my post from the other account the day I got my pregnancy test twoish weeks ago, a Wednesday, and got my pills on the following Monday. I did the vaginal route instead of the buccal route (as in I inserted the pills in my vagina as opposed to letting them dissolve in my mouth in my cheeks), because I didn’t know I should wait 24 hours to do the buccal route (which is like 8% more effective than the vaginal route, someone correct me but it’s somewhere around 8-12%) until the day of the appointment and fully broke down when they told me that. I’m sure that information was given to me during my first appointment and I was too stressed to hear it. The people taking care of me at planned parenthood were beautiful and amazing and so fucking kind, and I’m sure they told me that and I was just too scared and sad to hear it. \n\nSo we all agreed id do the vaginal route and I got home and comfy and surrounded myself with cozy stuff in preparation, and then nothing fucking happened. With the vaginal route it’s supposed to be 4-6 hours until cramping and bleeding starts and then one is supposed to start cramping harder and passing clots due to the uterus emptying. I got to hour 9 with a bit of spotting and what I’d consider extremely light period cramping, and went to bed assuming it didn’t work and I’d go back into PP in the morning for another dose. No biggie, I was prepared for this, not freaking out at all. \n\nSo I go into class and start feeling like I’m dying midway through. 🙃 I wasn’t, it was a delayed and incomplete reaction to the meds (the misoprostol, the second med one takes for a medication abortion). I went to the appt with PP I scheduled and they were like “this can be normal and your symptoms aren’t concerning so we’re gonna give you another dose.” Long story short, it worked and I’m unpregnant now (thank fucking Christ) but my god this fucking blew and I’m gonna describe it. \n\nI took the second dose buccal-y (??? spelling)  and I holed up in my nest again. The cramps still weren’t as bad as I thought they’d be, and frankly I passed fewer clots than last time but I think both of those are because I caught it earlier than last time (I was in the last week I could get a medication abortion last time, and I caught it this time before my missed period thanks to tracking my periods for the last 5 years). However, I stopped bleeding yesterday, which was a week and a half after my second dose, and I was still cramping until Thursday. \n\nBefore I get into the ending credits, I need to talk about my disability and how it may have affected my termination. I became disabled last year due to an intestinal infection (Shigella; look her up, shes ugly and I fucking hate her [this is the trauma talking, I’m very aware of my internalized misogyny and this isn’t it]) that triggered reactive arthritis. We don’t know yet if it’s the RA or the Shigella that fried my nerves but I have pretty severe neurological issues now, and I have to think that they relate to the medication not working properly. I stay pretty active for someone in my condition, I walk to and from my bus stop to get to college which is about two blocks to and from, I can clean my home most of the time and have no problem showering or otherwise maintaining my hygiene. But if I’m not going to or from school I’m sitting or laying down, and I think lack of physical activity added to either the first dose being ineffective and the second dose taking so long to just…. Get the job done and go home lol. I also have PMDD, and react horrifically to hormonal birth control, and this last week, emotionally, felt like PMDD hopped up on fucking tret (a steroid), coke, and whatever that Mountain Dew energy drink is. It truly felt like an incel had invaded my body and was trying to make me feel as shitty as fucking possible. \n\nSo, I’m now out of the woods. I’m not nauseous, my boobs don’t feel like they’re screaming in pain from wearing a bra, I’m not hyper emotional. Like, I think we’re actually fucking good now.\n\nIf any one has any questions, I’d love to answer them if I am able. I intend on keeping this post up because I was desperately looking for people’s experiences with their terminations before during and now, and I want this to be a resource for people. \n\nI sincerely thank every single person who lended me support, who told me their experiences, and supplied resources on my first post. This is a truly important and beautiful community, and I value the support and kindness generated by women who care about other women (born with a pussy or not!!!!! ALL women are my fucking sisters!)

I'm curious if any of the other types might be better though\n\n-Slynd - I'm on this currently and it's the best so far, but the problematic side effect is that I spot bleed most days of my cycle.

    "selftext": "I’m 34 and have had extremely heavy and painful periods since they started. I can’t use oestrogen contraception because of a family history of blood clotting.\n* I was on the depo injection for 15 years.\n\n* After stopping during Covid, I tried the Kyleena coil — I was in agony and bled every day for a year. Multiple ultrasounds and internal scans showed nothing. Eventually a doctor told me it should never have been fitted because I’m too narrow.\n\n* For the past 3 years I’ve used Natural Cycles. My cycles are around 20 days, so I often have 2 periods a month.\n\n* I’ve had at least 7 ultrasounds/internal scans, all \"normal.\" I’ve asked about hormones and endometriosis repeatedly, but my hormones have never been checked and endo has never been investigated beyond scans.\n\n* I had to complain to PALS just to get a referral to gynaecology.\n\nI finally saw a gynaecologist this week, but she hadn’t read my notes and suggested the coil again, despite my referral letter saying it should not be fitted again. She did agree I’m bleeding too heavily (5+ days of very heavy bleeding, in an 8-day period).\nShe prescribed me the progesterone-only pill. And now I feel completely stuck.\n* Hormonal contraception has always made me feel awful mentally — I lose my libido, can’t stand being touched, and it’s ruined relationships in the past.\n\n* I desperately want children. I’m 34 and very anxious about fertility declining after 35. I’m not financially ready now, but I feel like time is running out.\n\n* At the same time, my bleeding is unmanageable. I’m exhausted, in pain, dizzy, and it’s affecting work and daily life.\n\nI feel so defeated and like doctors just keep throwing contraception at me instead of actually investigating what’s going on. I don’t know whether to risk the progesterone-only pill for some relief, or keep fighting for more answers.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation — how did you cope? Did progesterone-only options help or hurt? Did you manage to get doctors to finally take you seriously?\nRight now I just feel really conflicted and would love to hear from anyone who’s been through something like this.

All three of those things are progesterone only, and for some reason Mirena is great while the others make me suicidal. I think POPs are worth a try for you, they effect everyone differently and just because other hormonal methods don't work for you doesn't mean it's hopeless at all.

    "selftext": "So a few months ago, my doctor told me that she wanted me to get an IUD due to the possibility of breast cancer in my family (mom had it, grandmother on my dad's side had it) and because I'll be 40 this year.\n\nI expressed concern, saying \"I've heard that those are painful.\"\n\nShe dead-ass looked at me and flippantly said \"oh, I don't know where you heard that from.  They're very quick and last a long time, no worries about missing a pill.\"\n\nSo I said fuck it, fine, I'll get one.  She was lowkey saying she \"wouldn't be comfortable\" keeping me on hormonal bc pills because of the above factors.\n\nI scheduled my appointment, and the morning-of, I took Tylenol because I'd heard a lot of stories about the valid and accurately reported pain/discomfort and wanted to be prepared.\n\nBoy was I not.\n\nThe doc who put the IUD in actually had a pleasant conversation with me - he noticed I was nervous and he assured me that he'd get it over with as quickly as possible.  He explained the process (have to use the speculum, have to measure, then have to insert) clearly and thoroughly, always pausing for questions.  He asked me what bc I was on, and I told him bc pills.  He asked if there was an issue with them and I said \"no, but my doctor wants me on the IUD.\"  He looked kind of concerned and asked why, literally said \"if it ain't broken, why fix it?\"\n\nAdmittedly, he did eye me very carefully as he gave me several \"outs\".  I appreciate that he had the emotional intelligence to give me those last precious chances to spare myself from this misery.\n\nI finally decided to just go through with it since it's good for 10 years, and for whatever reason, doctors make it a pain in the ass to get refills because they demand \"check-ins\" to make sure things are still working fine.\n\nI started taking deep, conscious breaths to keep myself calm.  Stared at a spot in the ceiling to give myself something to focus on.\n\nFirst it's a pinch.  And then it flat out feels like I'm being gutted from the inside.  Didn't scream, mind you, but I did groan and clench the sides of the bed and bear down and pressed myself into the medical bed.  I'm actually clawing my face and hair and writhing, it hurts so much.  He tells me that, because I'd not had any children, my cervix was very tight so they had to try several different sized tools to get in there for the measurement alone.  THAT was actual torture.  He was so calm and reassuring and very obviously cared about how I was feeling, to the point where he asked several times \"if you want to stop, we can stop - you're a champ all the same.\"\n\nHe also gently reassured me that we were \"almost done, just one more of those nasty cramps\" which again felt like getting a dagger shoved into my stomach through my vagina.  I'm in a cold sweat, feeling really dizzy, and shaking - but we finished.  He called me a warrior and said to take the time I needed to rest, but all I could think about was just how much it HURT.\n\nI laid there on the bed, tried to sit up and get my clothes on, and briefly considered just laying on the floor because it was hard for me to stay on my feet.  Honestly felt like I was going to faint.\n\nFinally shuffled my way out of the room, into the waiting room, and had to rest in the foyer.  I cursed the fact that it was a two-story building and took the elevator because fuck stairs currently.  Shuffled slowly to my car and flopped into the passenger seat, reclined it, and lay there.  Didn't care who parked next to me and wondered what was going on - I think I was out for about 45 minutes before I felt okay to drive.\n\nGot this done last Wednesday, to this day I'm still bleeding and cramping.  It's hard to sit up straight in a chair because I just feel so much pressure in that area.  I'm constantly bracing my abdomen to stabilize myself.  Does it ever get better or is suffering just my life now until I get it removed?\n\nI almost wonder if the reason why pregnancies on IUDs are rare is because you just never have sex again lol.",

This did not help.\n\nWhen it came time to remove it, my strings had vanished. So first I had to have an ultrasound to make sure it was still there and not embedded. Then because the doctor was convinced the strings were still in my cervix, he reached up in there and fished around until he grabbed them. That hurts just as bad as you would expect. The doc said if I couldn't handle the pain to let him know and they'd do some procedure more similar to a D&C to remove it. I joked that I'd definitely give him a heads up *before* kicking him in the teeth. He did not laugh.\n\nMoral of this story: check the strings regularly and don't go to an OBGYN whose office is at a Catholic Hospital and therefore doesn't even list birth control as a service they offer on their website to get it removed.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys my girlfriend and me are desperate for some advice.\n\nAs you can see in the pictures, she has this skin rash in her face around the mouth area, which appears after kissing me (her boyfriend) and then gets worse by day and only disappears after 4+ weeks of no contact with me. This has been going on for over 3 years and nothing has helped so far. The is worst around the mouth area, but sometimes “travels” to the eyes and temple. You should also know, I am completely unaffected by this, my skin is always clear and always has been.\n\nWe have been to multiple dermatologists and in our last visit it was concluded that it is a Perioral dermatitis. We both got broad range antibiotics and two creams for her and are currently trying this out. Our hopes are not that high right now, because we have tried so many things and nothing worked. She has taken so many pills and creams over months, but nothing helped so far.\n\nYou should know that I have a beard, picture attached. I tried using a brush to make it softer, used beard conditioner and tried to keep it as clean as possible, even though my beard is pretty soft already. I also tried growing it longer, which did not help either, but it is hard to test each new try, because it takes so long to go away, even with no physical contact at all. I also tried to shave the beard completely, the problem with that is, that if I clean shave in the morning, in the afternoon my chin is like sandpaper again already.\n\nWe considered it might be an allergy to my saliva or sperm, but the dermatologist ruled that out, but please feel free to leave your thoughts on this.\n\nShe usually uses makeup, but has tried to use no makeup at all for some time, which did not help either.\n\nThe dermatologist suspected an allergy of hers to my skincare products, but I don’t use any. No moisturizer, no cream, no perfume etc.\n\nWe are kind of hopeless at this point, since none of our efforts have helped so far, so we are hoping this community might have some anecdotal tips for us, if you have experienced something similar.",

Antifungal cream for us both cleared it up once and forever. I don’t recall my partner having symptoms himself but I got a very localized rash after any kind of skin contact. \n\nLook at photos of facial yeast infections. Your pics are a good match. \n\nThrush is a yeast infection—candidiasis. Typically it doesn’t present on the skin which is presumably why it’s often overlooked in favor of more common rashes. You may have physical signs on your skin which are covered up by your beard. Or have little presentation at all. You can still spread it. \n\nLuckily it is very common and easy to treat! It sounds like there may be an antifungal medication you can take successfully instead of a cream— a commenter below said they had success with Diflucan.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23201-yeast-infection-on-face",

    "title": "\"Natural\" skincare did me dirty😭 In just 2 weeks I'm amazed at the progress my skin has made by intentionally incorperating products❤️ [B&A]",
    "selftext": "It been less than 2 weeks with a new routine - so take this post with a grain of salt considering hormonal fluctuations may have an effect - BUT the way my skin feels and the lack of acne, texture and hyperpigmentation so soon after switching my skincare routine is blowing my mind and I can't wait to keep going.\n\nI'm 30F and have dry, acne prone skin. I'm shinier in the first pic due to slathering myself in castor oil and the right side I just have my daily moisturizer on.\n\nMY CURRENT ROUTINE:\n\nAM:\n- warm water\n- Cocokind Acne Serum (5 days/wk)\n- Cermedx Ceramide Facial Lotion\n- Raw Elements Face & Body Lotion SPF 30\n\nPM:\n- Andalou Naturals creamy vitamin C cleanser (I'll be replacing this soon)\n- Humphreys Witch Hazel Toner\n- Reviva Labs Glycolic Acid Toner\n- Cermedx Ceramide Facial Lotion\n- Raw Elements Face & Body Lotion SPF 30\n\nMY BACKSTORY:\n\nI had perfect skin in highschool when I used baby oil as a makeup remover and clean & clear morning burst face wash and random Aveeno or Dove moisturizers religiously.\n\nWhen I turned 21, I began learning about health, nutrition and the importance of knowing what went in and on my body. This is where my acne journey began. Initially my skin exploded (I don't have that picture) from stopping bc pills and cleaning up my diet.\n\nTo keep a very long story short, my skincare also changed when I became adamant that if I couldn't pronounce/eat (🙄) it I wouldn't use it on my face. Make up didn't count lol. But I still tried to keep things \"clean\"...\n\nMY OLD ROUTINE:\n\nFor the last ~8 years I have been using coconut oil as a makeup remover, castile soap as my cleanser (which I know realize i did a terrible job at using) and my moisturizer rotated between coconut oil/almond oil/castor oil/tallow.\n\nMy diet and lifestyle have been healthier than anyone I personally knew and I have been at a loss wondering why my skin continued to break out in random spots and feel so textured.\n\nI tried everything over the years, saunas, tea tree and lavender oils, lemon juice, aloe, apple cider vinegar, clay masks, charcoal, magnesium spray, supplements, keto, vegan, raw vegan, high intensity exercise, I'm sure there's more but you get the gist.\n\nI genuinely believed that if my internal was healthy then my skincare accounted for a very small percentage of the health and clarity of my skin.\n\nI also resisted the use of regular sunscreen (only when I was at the lake, beach or pool) because I thought it was a GOOD thing for me to bake in the sun with little protection. Now I know better.\n\nTHE PRESENT:\n\nNow am truly convinced all the oils I was using on my skin and the lack of proper cleansing led to these years of unexplained acne. So simple but I was ignorant. And ignorance is not always bliss!\n\nAll this to stay... I still greatly prioritize my health and reducing my exposure to harmful chemicals BUT I'm not so afraid anymore of \"unnatural\" products if it means my skin is happy and on the mend.\n\nI plan to order some mineral (baby) oil w/o fragrance added to use for my makeup remover and I just ordered a few peoducts from Cocokind since I've been loving their acne serum.\n- Cocokind AHA Jelly Cleanser (to replace my current Andalou Naturals)\n- Cocokind Beginner Retinol .1% Retinoid Complex\n- Cocokind Ceramide Lip Balm with SPF\n\nI can't wait to see the progress and hopefully can slowly but surely have the clear, smooth skin I've wanted for so long.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or a similar experience. I would love to know your feedback on my routine or if youve tried any of the products I mentioned. Thanks for reading❤️",

    "title": "[Acne] Mirena IUD ruined my skin (and life) ",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Birth control (mirena IUD) caused wicked acne, took 3 years to figure out that it was the cause.\n\nThis post has been a long time in the making. For context, my first Mirena IUD was inserted in 2018 following a blood clot, I could no longer take the pill. In 2023, I had that IUD removed due to time, and a new Mirena inserted. 3 months after it was inserted, my skin completely blew up. The first IUD did not cause acne like the second one did. I had struggled with acne for ages - which was why I started birth control so young. But this was a different beast.\n\nI saw three different PC doctors, nutritionists, dermatologists, OBs, and everyone said I had PCOS - that was the only answer. I took spironolactone, doxycycline, metformin - nothing helped. I was absolutely losing my mind. My self confidence was down the toilet, as a 29 year old with raging acne. I would wake up every morning and cry, stare into a magnifying mirror daily wondering how I was going to live my life like this forever. I focused on my skincare, changed my diet, stopped drinking coffee, dairy, and alcohol. I changed my exercise routine - started doing low impact movement and weights. Was taking every supplement recommended for PCOS and hormone imbalances. Started getting regular facials. Nothing helped. After 3 years of trying to figure out the combination, reading every reddit thread, I really did not know what to do. I was at a complete loss. Until I came across a 5 year old reddit thread where someone said their IUD caused hormonal acne. I immediately went to my camera roll and that's when I noticed the acne started 3 months after insertion. It was like a light switch and I realized that my IUD could even cause this - I never thought that since my first one didn't do this to me, and none of my doctors mentioned this could be a side effect. The next day, I went to my OB and had my IUD removed. A few weeks passed, and I started to see relief. 3 months after removal, I wasn't getting any new breakouts and things started healing. I also started seeing a new esthetician who specializes in hormonal acne. It's now been nearly 6 months without the IUD, and while my skin is not perfect, I'm finally able to focus on healing.\n\nI'm sharing this because of the pain I was in for years. The physical pain from the cysts, and the emotional pain I felt on a daily basis. If you are struggling with acne, I see you. I feel for you. And I know the constant nag that is in your head, looking at everyone else's skin asking yourself \"why not me.\" Keep trying. Keep educating yourself, and don't rely on doctors for the only source of truth. I am so thankful to the reddit community for sharing their experiences. As a woman, I felt so much pressure to be on birth control - that that was the only way to control your life. When in fact, birth control was the reason why I had no control. As a 29 year old, 13 of those years were on birth control. I had never lived an adult day of my life actually knowing what my body felt like without it - what my cycle was like without it. It has single handedly been the best decision I have made in my 20s.",

I recently saw an esthetician who told me my breakouts are hormonal and that I probably won’t have clear skin until after I have kids (which I really hope is a long way off, lol).\nFor context:\n- I have dry skin.\n- Acne mostly show up on my cheeks, jawline, and chin.\n- I’m not on any hormonal contraception, but I tried the progesterone only pill a few years ago and found no difference in my skin\n- I rarely get acne on my nose or forehead.\nIt’s frustrating because all my friends seem to have clear, glowing skin, and I feel like I look older than I actually am (I’m only 20). People even tell me I look a lot older than my boyfriend, even though he’s older than me.\nRight now, my routine looks like this:\n- Double cleanse at night\n- La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo before bed\n- Weleda Skin Food in the morning under light makeup\n- Balanced diet + probiotics daily\nI just can’t accept that my skin is “stuck” like this until way down the line.

Depending on where you live, do discuss azelaic acid with a dermatologist, and:\n\n- Water wash in the morning only,\n\n- Use Spf to avoid and limit further sun damage and marks; LRP Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid should be great for your skin, and you can get a tinted version if you’re into that.\n\n- Any oil-free moisturizer should be great to restore your skin barrier. The Weleda I believe isn’t oil-free. Maybe move the Effaclar to day time before the sunscreen, and for night time azelaic acid followed by LRP Hydraphase Light or any lightweight oil free moisturizer (confirm to me whether Weleda is oil-free because iirc it isn’t).\n\n\nConsistency is key, and I’m betting some good money on azelaic acid for your face ❤️",

    "title": "[Personal] It’s Okay to Not Buy the Dupe",
    "selftext": "For context, I am a 29-year old Black woman who started getting acne in 5th grade. The emergence of never-ending hyperpigmentation, blackheads, and cystic acne launched a near 2-decade fight to find solutions to my problems. Proactiv, Dove soap, doxycycline, Clindamycin gel, birth control pills, TWO SEPARATE ROUNDS of Accutane, natural skincare, K-Beauty, budget skincare, higher-end skincare, skin flooding, DDG Peel Pads, azelaic acid, adapeline, tretinoin - YOU NAME IT, I TRIED IT. \n\nAnd yet, the acne remained. And got worse.\n\nSo, after avoiding leaving my house because of my skin (for the millionth time), I finally decided to make a list and accept what doesn’t work for my skin - most AHAs and BHAs, azelaic acid, Vitamin C, ferments, “natural skincare”, and most formulations of more budget friendly products. \n\nAs a result, I finally found a routine that works for me. Is it expensive? Yes. Is it a waste of money? To some, yes. Is there a dupe of everything I use? To me, no.\n\nAnd that’s what matters. \n\nI see so many posts asking for “dupes” of higher end products, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. But there is also nothing wrong with using the expensive thing that works.\n\nI’m not rolling in dough. I rarely get my hair or nails done, and I don’t have children or student loans. I recognize my privilege in even making this post. But do not feel like you are doing “too much” or it’s a “waste of money” to spend more on products that work for you. And if you’re like me, you’ve probably spent more money trying to find dupes than just using the original product anyway. \n\nIf anyone’s curious, this is my current routine:\n\nAM\n* Laneige Water Bank Gel Cleanser\n* Dermalogica Microfoliant\n* Tatcha Dewy Serum\n* Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream\n* Skin1004 Sun Serum (the original formulation)\n\nPM\n* Tatcha Oil Cleanser\n* Tatcha Rice Wash\n* Tatcha Dewy Serum\n* Tazarotene\n* Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream\n* Laneige Cica Sleeping Mask\n\nAnd between almost every step I’m spraying my face with Avene Thermal Spring Water\n\nI recently ordered the Bloom Effects Brightening Regenerative Serum to incorporate into my routine. Do I love that it’s $89? Absolutely not. But it’s a product that promotes skin brightening without significant amounts of AHAs or BHAs, so I’m willing to try it. \n\nIt’s okay to buy the expensive thing. It’s okay to buy the less expensive thing. Do what works for YOU.\n\nBest of luck on your skincare journeys, everyone 🫡\n\nEdit: Ya girl still can’t use BHAs, so the microfoliant has been removed from the routine. I don’t know who I thought I was 🙄 trying out enzyme only exfoliant from now on!\n\nThe Bloomeffects serum hasn’t caused any adverse effects. It will take time to see significant results, but it’s lightweight and doesn’t break me out, which is all I can ask for. ",

    "title": "Feeling hopeless about my skin after two rounds of Accutane and have no idea what to do about my acne and textured skin, please help [Acne]",
    "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nI am in serious need of advice about what to do about my skin. I am 25F and feel like I've exhausted all options for my skin and I just don't know what to do. Emotionally and mentally I'm feeling devastated and that I am just destined for problematic skin which is painful to even think about.\n\nTo keep a long story somewhat short, I started getting acne at age 12, every single kind; blackheads, whiteheads, cysts, closed comedones, etc. I have tried countless topicals, skincare routines, diets, estheticians, supplements, pills you name it nothing ever solved my issues.\n\nEverything relevant I've tried over the years: Cutting out dairy/sugar, Being vegan for a year, Birth Control, Spironolactone, Salicylic Acid, Benzyl Peroxide, Clindamycin/Benzyl Peroxide cream, Epiduo, Monthly Esthetician visits, Did a 3-month \"Acne Bootcamp\", Adapalene, Tretinoin both gel and cream form, Minocycline, Supplements, \"All natural skincare\", and finally Accutane!\n\nMy first round of Accutane was in 2022 and it cleared my skin beautifully, I had skin that I never imagined I could have. No active breakouts, minimal texture, smooth feeling skin, smaller pores and finally I was able to clear the years of hyperpigmentation. My skin was beautiful, glowing, smooth, my confidence was through the roof. I just felt so \"free\", I wasn't constantly worried about how my skin looked in certain lighting, my skin didn't feel icky or congested. I wasn't oily anymore, I just had smooth normal looking skin, everything I wanted!\n\nFast forward to August 2024 I noticed my skin was getting oily again and closed comedones/texture returning, instead of experimenting with topicals I did a second course of Accutane starting in September 2024. This course ending up being stronger than my last. I got all the way up 80mg for one month while I only ever got to 40mg on my first. Once again my skin cleared up beautifully but I experienced hair loss :( so not great, which I'm still dealing with today. I lost a lot of density all throughout my hair and am still experiencing significant shedding. Now to make matters worse not even three months after finishing my skin began ramping up oil again and little bumps started popping up.\n\nSo instead of trying to fix the issue on my own I went back to my Derm and they prescribed me Arazlo lotion, which I have been using for a month. The issue is my skin is not doing well, what started as a few small bumps is now reminiscent of my skin pre-Accutane. I have a cluster of whiteheads on my chin which I haven't experienced since before my first round, lots of congestion, bumps, texture and now dark marks being left behind. It feels like years of progress is going down the drain.\n\nMy skin feels both dry and oily and sticky, like I can feel my pores getting clogged. But what really bothers me the most is the overall texture of my skin, it's is bumpy and rough like the entire surface of my skin is textured. My pores look massive and I feel like the condition of my skin makes me look older than my age. I am worried that if my skin looks like this now as I get older these issues will get worse.\n\nAccutane was the only thing that gave me semi normal skin texture wise but I guess it's only temporary for me. I just don't know what to do to that will give me skin I feel confident and comfortable with. I feel like there's no point in me even trying it's like my skin is resistant to being nice. If anyone has any advice on what I should do, or consider doing. I don't want this to be my skin forever or get worse with age.\n\nAM Routine:\n\nWash face with cold water\n\nApply Tizo Photoceutical AM Replenish Lightly Tinted SPF 40 or TiZO 3 Facial Mineral Sunscreen and Primer Tinted SPF40 or Face Reality SPF 30 Plus\n\nPM Routine:\n\nWash face with cool water and Vanicream Gentle Cleanser\n\nApply Face Reality Barrier Care Gel Cream\n\nApply Arazlo 3x a week without moisturizer",

I'm sorry to hear the second round didn't have long term effects for you :' makes me worried about the way mine will go long term. \n\nJust wondering, but are you possibly taking any supplements that include Vitamin B? This especially applies to Vit B6 and B12. I ask because I notice my current acne looks pretty similar to yours, and it definitely gets worse when I regularly take Vit B supplements. There are also studies that have shown it can correlate with increased oil/sebum production in a way that can increase acne. I unfortunately have to take B12 supplements due to a deficiency, but that can be something you might be able to cut down on.\n\nOtherwise, I will say- if you feel the Arazlo lotion isn't helping, it's very ok to stop taking it. It's possible you might be sensitive to an ingredient in it, since it seems you feel your acne has gotten worse since starting it. \n\nSimilarly, if you've been using your current moiturizer(the Barrier Care Gel Cream) for a while and you feel your skin isn't doing great while you're using it, it could be worth trying out a different moisturizer. I checked out the ingredients in it, and it seems to be a really long list that could make it hard to figure out which individual ingredient you're sensitive to.\n\nI've had a lot of trouble finding moisturizer that works in the past, but one that consistently works for me is straight up Aveeno Daily Lotion (the generic kind they advertise for body, not just for face). It's a really minimal formulation, but I find it really calms my acne in comparison to other ones I've tried. It also works well under sunscreen as long as it's dried down enough.",

    "title": "[Acne] Post-pill acne. How long do I wait?",
    "selftext": "I am 32. I quit the pill 13 months ago after taking it for 15+ years, and I have been breaking out for 10 months.\n\nMy hair also fell out for 9 months. \n\nI did not have acne as a teenager, and do not have a genetic disposition to it. I probably got 1 zit a year on the pill at most despite wearing makeup every day, and 'cleaning' my face with a wet wipe.\n\nAcne is often linked to gut health. \nI starved myself through my 20s and then panic binged on junkfood in the weekends. \n\nI cut out all processed food, and am now eating a whole food plant-based diet, roughly following Dr. Greger's guidelines since the start of this year.\nI also started PuraU 2.5 weeks ago, but no positive change yet (my skin has worsened, but that's probably because I stopped topical tretinoin).\n\nI have been slow tapering off a benzodiazepene for a few years, which has wrecked havoc on my nervous system and put my mind and body under immense stress. I'm nearly off, but the stress/anxiety and other symptoms won't be helping.\n\nI got full bloodwork done today. I am awaiting the results. However, even if my hormone levels appear normal, it can still be post-pill acne since the skin regulates hormones independently, and other factors like oil gland sensitivity and hormonal readjustment after stopping the pill can contribute.\n\nI really want to continue to try to heal my acne through my gut health rather than taking something like doxy and then accutance if it returns. But my confidence and self esteem is so shot, so it will be a last resort if it doesn't work.\n\nHas anyone had post-pill acne take longer than a year (since the acne begun), then heal??\n\n ",

Then start using the Epiduo all over your face every other day once your skin doesn’t feel as irritated. \n\nI’m not sure where you’re located, or what you’re financial situation is, but if you’re in the market for some new products, I recommend the Krave Beauty Matcha Cleanser (safe to order on Amazon), Avene thermal water spray, Experiment Beauty’s Super Saturated serum and their Molecular Mesh moisturizer.

    "selftext": "I’m 26 year of female. I have struggled with acne since I was 11. I started birth control at 13 and was on accutane at 14 but didn’t finish full course. I did not have any acne again until I was 21. Acne does not run in my family- nobody else has had acne like me. \n\nOnce I was 21 my acne returned. I always dealt with cystic acne all over my face. It was the worst on my cheeks and chin. I trialed everything up until last summer. I have extremely sensitive skin. I struggle with rashes, eczema, chronic hives, and a lot of allergic reactions. The only brand for skincare I can use is vanicream. I have tried everything. I was put on a 2nd round of accutane from June 2024-January 2025. I took 30MG. I am 5foot and under 100lbs so my dose was due to my weight. \n\nI had very occasional pimples around my period after I finished accutane. It was amazing having confidence again. In June I began having more consistent acne. Mainly my chin and nose. I have mostly dry skin but there’s times it’s combo. My dermatologist put me on Amoxicillin for a month. It did help and my skin was pretty clear until a month ago. I started getting worsening acne on my chin. Mostly a lot of nodules and maybe 3-4 smaller cyst like pimples. I saw my dermatologist last week and we discussed options. I am planning on getting pregnant soon and we both agreed no more accutane. My body cannot handle it also. No spironolactone due to having a baby soon - i also have 1 kidney so it’s too risky with the diuretic effects. I have trialed every topical you can think of previously. My current routine since February has been Vanicream face wash, clindamycin gel and vanicream moisturizer AM and PM. \n\nShe suggested doing tretinoin spot treatment and when needed adding a steroid topical and missing it with the tretinoin. I did not do good previously with tret. 2 weeks ago I only used it twice and no surprise I had way worse acne, redness, burning, and a rash. I have not used it since. I have been doing my routine and then using pimple patches occasionally. In the mornings my acne looks a bit better, then by the afternoon it’s red and inflamed. I was taking prenatals starting in June. I found out they can worsen acne so I also stopped those 2 weeks ago to see if that was contributing. Also started getting chest acne. Haven’t had that in like 2 years. I’m using my face wash and clindamycin, it is improving a bit.\n\nI really do not know what to do. As far as I know I have no other options. I did send my derm a message with all the above and requested another trial of antibiotics. I am aware it is hormonal. I am still on birth control pill right now. I also do eat healthy. cannot help but feel hopeless. h similar. I have worked so hard on my skin and I need to find something that will help bring this down. With my allergies it makes things so much harder. I’m not asking for it to all go away but I want it to improve. \n\nAny advice, tips, experiences I would love. This is really hard to deal with and it is isolating. ",

(for history, i was on this patch and previously the pill for 4 - 5 years. had to stop due to insurance reasons but that will not happen again after this awful breakout. i literally feel hideous)",

Anyways I came off around 26 just because I was curious what my normal cycle was like.

Acne didn’t come back til 10 months postpartum. Didn’t even have acne during pregnancy. But it’s back BAD. I went on spironolactone again but it’s not working like last time (I know it’s because I’m not on the BC pill but I’d like to have another baby soon). This time the Spiro is really messing with my cycle too since I’m not on the pill. I’m just so over this journey and the “solves” are now just giving me new problems. Please tell me someone out there has successfully healed their post pill acne. This is not a job for topicals. They can help treat but they don’t help new hormonal acne from forming. I just want to be DONE. Mentally & physically. ",

I stopped birth control like six years ago after being on for five, nasty horrible breakouts that wouldn't quit so after 8 months of waiting and hoping I went back on, for two more years. Tried to stop again, same thing just painful and awful. But about ten months ago I stopped again because the pill gives me bad depression and I just can't take it anymore and I have had literally the lightest acne, just one or two small ones before my period and using Tretinion just takes care of it so easily (I tried using Tretinion the last two times and it was not helpful and made it much more sensitive).\n\nI think it comes down to hormones and for me I was in my late twenties when I tried quitting before, and now I am approaching my mid thirties and I have to guess that things have just calmed down hormonally in general and that's why it's been so much better this time. I never had acne before the pill, I was just using it for birth control. I literally feel so much off the pill and I'm so happy I tried again and was successful. All this is to say that I did it all the last couple times, supplements, products prescriptions and nothing helped and suddenly now it's just not an issue anymore. I couldn't fight my hormones and I just feel like I'm lucky it finally let up. I had almost convinced myself I'd be on the pill forever. Not sure how old you are but depending on your age perhaps it's just a waiting game for you as well.

Mainly worried about psychosis and anxiety.\n\nI’ve had bad acne since I was 14 years old. I went on the combo pill for it at 15 which completely got rid of it. At around 21-22 it started coming back (if I remember correctly, it started coming back when I was on the pill). Ended up stopping the pill anyway because of increased risk of blood clots. \n\nAt 23 my acne was absolutely horrible. Cystic acne with large lumps with two or three heads. Lots of pimples. I got it mostly under control by using Epiduo where I’d get a few pimples but it wasn’t too bad. I was on it for years. I couldn’t use it for a few days due to running out of my prescription recently. Since then my acne has come back - not as bad but definitely not good. The Epiduo really isn’t working anymore and I’m at my wits end. \n\nI won’t let myself take combo birth control due to being overweight and being a smoker, and my last option now is accutane. \n\nI’m 29 and female, and I suffer from generalised anxiety disorder. I’m terrified of accutane affecting my mental health and suffering from worse anxiety or even psychosis. I have no family history of schizophrenia or psychosis that I can think of, but depression and anxiety does run in my family. \n\nI guess I’m just asking for some reassurance that I’ll be okay (if anyone else has family history that is the same and has still taken accutane with no problems) and can tell me their experiences. \n\nThank you in advance 🥺",

    "selftext": "Hey there, hope this is ok to post here, have never used reddit before! In desperate advice/help for closed comedones for any skincare experts out there or have experienced the same, - at my wits end with them😩. I’ve struggled with closed comedones since 2021 over my forehead and sides of my cheeks. since then i’ve tried endless products, multiple doctors appointments and certain things have helped - particularly prescribed epiduo on my forehead which is partly comedone free now - but the comedones on my cheeks will not budge. My GP prescribed me doxycycline around september last year which I did 2 months on. didn’t notice the biggest change, but general breakouts lessened. I went back to my GP start of February this year as comedones still very present on my cheeks, to which she prescribed another round of doxycycline which i’ve just finished. keep in mind, i’ve been using epiduo with this medication. I suggested going on the pill to possibly help with the oil production which i’m assuming is clogging my pores causing the comedones but she advised not to since i don’t have large pustule acne which I understand. Due to my location my local dermatologist has a year waiting list😩. I try not to and i know your not advised to try to pop the comedones, but some seem to be just literally stuck, i can see the sebum - so when i pop them - a string of sebum does come out (tmi soz. it’s satisfying but they just keep filling up!) I have combination skin - very oily in my T zone and forehead but chin and lower cheeks are very dry (i’m assuming from the benzoyl peroxide).

        "text": "I had closed comodones nearly identical to yours until about a year ago. I started double cleansing and they are 95% gone.\nFor reference, I live in a super dry climate and have Hashimotos which makes my skin extra super duper prone to being dry.\nI double cleanse with a cleansing balm in the shower or a cleansing oil at my sink and wash with a BHA cleanser to get the oil off. \nEven using tretinoin from the semi shady Indian pharmacy constantly did nothing for them\n\nThe only area I still get comedones is on my chin and I have started using 10% glycolic acid on it (from willow wholesale on Amazon) and those are rapidly disappearing. They only come up on days like today where I slept in my makeup and didn’t wash my face until 4 pm. Occasionally I’ll get some tiny almost black head like dots on my cheeks but I never get surprise dots that are secretly huge pus filled blackheads anymore. And I don’t get them along my jaw line.\n\nHere’s my routine - \nCleansing balm - COSRX full fit cica smoothing balm \nOr -\nPapa recipe blemish cleansing oil \n\nHaruharu wonder black rice triple cleansing gentle AHA gel\nBare minerals salicylic acid gel cleanser \n\nNaturium vitamin c all over \n.05% tretinoin gel on my lines and any active spots \nWillow wholesale 10% glycolic acid all over areas I get comedones (one layer, do NOT overdo this as it will burn your skin off in 3+ layers. I also use this on my KP and it works gloriously!)\n5% salicylic acid from Pure Original Ingredients store \n\nIunik beta glucan moisturizer - my absolute holy grail for 5 years \nHyaluronic acid mixed with water in a spray bottle misted on my face \n\nAnd I remember to clean my pillowcase or switch it out… sometimes. Maybe once every 4-6 weeks. \n\nI also shower at night and never go to bed if I feel like I have exerted myself quite a bit that day. Showering at night helps ensure that my bed stays clean longer and my skin isn’t just marinating in its own juices. And I sleep on my back usually, sometimes turned on my right side (which is where I get comedones 90% of the time).\n\nAlso, probiotics, but not shitty ones. Three-lac is the best one I have ever found and will absolutely make you fart like a dairy cow the first few days. But your skin will be gorgeous after. \n\nI got all the Asian products from olive young",

    "title": "[acne] worried about post-pill acne",
    "selftext": "hello! i am a 20 year old woman and i had been taking a hormonal birth control pill (nikki) from the ages of ~13 up until july 29th of this year. i originally got on it to help manage my acne, and i discontinued it mostly out of fear from discovering that it has been classified as a class 1 carcinogenic for quite some time now. i am aware that it works as a preventative for some types of cancer, but i figured that i have never really known myself off of birth control so it was time anyway. i am not particularly interested in continuing hormonal methods of birth control, and i am heavily considering getting a copper IUD. the only problem with this is that i have seen most people say that post pill acne can show up anywhere from 3 months-1 year later. as of now it has been about 3 months post-pill and my skin is fine and i have a solid skincare routine, but from my understanding that doesn’t mean so much when it is hormonal acne. i’m just worried about getting the copper IUD and then acne popping up and having to get back on the pill (which i don’t want to do) but acne has always been a problem for me and is honestly confidence shattering. i can’t be on the pill forever, i just don’t know what to do. suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated! :)",

I’m sorry you experienced an unwanted pregnancy despite doing the right thing - but yes, it happens. \n\nI especially appreciate your clarity about the termination procedure. I do think there is a lot of misinformation out there about how abortion works and what it’s like.\n\nEven for people using highly effective forms of birth control, it’s important to always have a plan for how to handle unwanted pregnancy. I’m glad that you had a plan - you got emergency contraceptive and later took a test so you could be informed and process next steps. \n\nIt sounds like you are doing well. While I can imagine the emotional toll still weighs heavily, I’m glad you were able to get through what sounds like a pretty difficult situation with grace and support.",

There's also a copper IUD or hormonal IUD (how your body processes it is a bit different than oral contraception). \n\nEmergency contraception usually has 1.5 mg of levonorgestrel per tablet but also comes in 0.75mg that you have to take twice, [such as the I-Pill](https://www.drugs.com/dosage/levonorgestrel.html#Usual_Adult_Dose_for_Postcoital_Contraception). In comparison, [Alesse 21 & 28](https://www.rexall.ca/article/drug/view/id/626/) each contain 100mcg, or 0.1mg of levonorgestrel.  I know there are previous posts from other women who solely rely on EC; there is a reason why you feel like crap after taking an EC tablet, It's a lot of particular hormones all at once. \n\nAgain thank you for sharing your story, I wish more women would share their stories.

I feel it's extremely valuable, as so many seek to scare women away from abortion procedures just to force them to continue unwanted pregnancies. \n\nI do have one concern: you say you did \"everything right\", but you don't mention what birth control you were using. It's very important to understand that emergency birth control is to be used when birth control fails. When a condom breaks, when you forget a pill (or, sadly, in the event of SA). Having unprotected sex intentionally and just taking emergency contraception afterwards is not how it's meant to be used. Some women abuse emergency birth control by using it this way- as their plan A instead of a plan B. This diminishes the effectiveness eventually, and plays havoc with your body, as it is a large dose of hormones. Using only emergency contraception as a main form of contraception is not \"doing everything right\". \n\nI don't say this to be judgemental or mean or cruel, but, as you say, some people are very misinformed- through no fault of their own, sometimes, but due to living in conservative areas or being targeted by misinformation algorithms on social media.",

Since having my babes I tried Loloestrinfe which made me have suicidal ideation, then Nextellis which improved my mood but made me bloated with joint pain and cravings. I ran out and had a like five days of no pill and I felt light as a feather and happy. Then I got the nuvaring after five days of sleepiness, bloating and being so grumpy to my family I’m taking it out!! I’m trying the mini pill now which is a progesterone only pill no more fake estrogen. Wish me luck! Happy for u!!",

Personally, I am very pro birth control and always the first to give a rebuttal to people who claim it’s poison for your body or “changes you” (beyond just typical side effects) but I had a really bad experience on Yaz. I think its combo of estrogen plus an anti-androgenic progestin makes it really a bad fit for some (not all) people. I’ve realized over time that my body needs some androgenic balance and I think that’s why I felt such intense effects from it. No other birth control pill, besides Yasmin and other variants or generics of Yaz, has quite that strong of an anti-androgenic combo. It makes sense why some people experience very noticeable and undesirable side effects then, since it doesn’t really replicate everyone’s natural hormones and may feel like an abrupt change. \n\nOf course to whoever reading this, YMMV—not everyone seems to be affected by androgenic content of pills and things. But some people really are and for those of us who are and who have taken Yaz, I think we can agree that quitting made quite the difference!",

It really made me feel better functionally as a person.\n\n\nHowever, I didnt know they were still making it? Or maybe they quit and restarted it. \n\nI stopped birth control after college and then went to restart when I started dating my now husband. My doctor refused to re-prescribe Yaz because he said it was discontinued for killing women (strokes etc.) So I went through a horribly uncomfortable trial and error period with various pills that sucked the life out of me until I finally found another doctor who agreed to give me the Mirena despite never being pregnant before.",

        "comment_text": "Aside from the birth control discussion itself, I want to point out how important it is to be mindful of what you're being fed on the internet and what you're consuming. \n\nEven on Reddit, they will recommend subreddits for you to check out based on other things you've looked at. Same with TikTok, Instagram, etc. \n\nIt's important to consider how your feeds are curated and how the algorithm supports that. So if you're looking up information on birth control, then pregnancy rates on birth control or birth control failure rate, you will see more of that. Or with TikTok, you don't even have to search those things but if the app sees you've watched a video for more than a few seconds, indicating you just didn't scroll past it, it will recognize that and feed you similar TikToks. So if you even listen to a video for a few seconds longer (even when you don't consciously choose to stop at a video), TikTok remembers and will give you more of that content. \n\nAdditionally, it is more likely people will come to the Internet where you have access to more information, more people sharing a variety of experiences and ability to be anonymous. Consider that, plus people who are in a state of fear, uncertainty, etc. are more likely to post to seek reassurance, clarity, etc. Less likely people are here talking about positive experiences (obviously not non-existent). So then your worries and thoughts are continually fed by the same ideas/narrative (and this is done to keep you on these platforms longer).\n\nSo although **you** see a lot of posts about pregnancy while on birth control, you need to keep in mind how much of it is the algorithm? And based on years of medical research and use of these methods of contraception, what's the average efficacy? Like others mentioned, these personal anecdotes/posts don't include all the circumstances in that individuals life that may have led to the pregnancy (not using birth control properly, drug interactions, etc.)\n\nInternet is helpful, but always do your due diligence to get the full picture (or as much as possible).",

You’re not stuck forever, if you don’t like how you feel, you can just stop or try something different with your physician's guidance.\n\nI’ve also seen plenty of patients actually feel better on it. They feel safer, less stressed about pregnancy, sometimes their cycles or cramps improve, sometimes even skin or weight. Those positive experiences don’t usually go viral here lol, but they’re very common.\n\nYour anxiety is trying to protect you by focusing on worst case scenarios, but in real life the odds are very much in your favor. Give yourself permission to try it, knowing you’ve got your doctor as backup. If it works, awesome. If not, that’s okay too. Either way, you’re going to be alright.",

If you experience mild side effects it's worth sticking with it for around 3 months to see if they improve. \nBut if in the future you feel that the cons of being on a certain birth control outweigh the pros for you, you can always switch methods or get off BC entirely. \nBirth control side effects go away pretty quickly after you stop using it. \n\n\nThe risk of having a blood clot is very small. \nAbout 5-12 in 10,000 people on birth control *with estrogen* will have a blood clot each year, compared to 2-5 in 10,000 women of the same age not on BC. \nIf that number still seems too high to you or you are already at higher risk for some reason you can use progestin-only methods that don't increase your risk of clots, like the minipill, arm implant or (if you ever change your mind about it) hormonal IUD.",

When I came off of bc it was because it was giving me neurological symptoms such as epilepsy so I'm not a normal case, but I had breakthrough bleeding a bit before. Anyway, I had a heavier period but it actually wasn't as heavy as beforehand and I had less pain, though I went on bc in the first place to eliminate these things, it was only expected to be stopped whilst I was taking bc. Then within 6 months everything went back to normal and regulated itself. It might be irregular or you might have a long period to begin with, but I would suggest trying, seeing which things you can tolerate more (side affects of bc or period symptoms) and giving it a few months before making a decision. Remember it may take a bit for your hair too, and age I think can thin your hair a little as well. I think your partner probably didn't expect you to ask hence the reaction and he's obviously never considered it before but it does seem like an overreaction, but you have every right to be free of hormones, especially given what you've stated above. Also, you don't have to bear the burden of bc alone as there are other options like condoms etc. I would hold off on the snip only because vasagel looks like it'll be approved next year and the studies I've read are pretty promising, and it's the same thing but completely reversible. 😊",

It is not poison for your body. Does it have side effects? Sure. Do really basic, non-demonized medications (like Tylenol) also have side effects? Also yes. Birth control is incredibly well-researched and safe. It also sometimes has more positive effects than negative or neutral ones, like if it helps with periods. You hit the nail on the head: people are demonizing it. It’s about the narratives that are being spread that are not rooted in fact or are only anecdotal. \n\nBottom line, this is your body, and some people don’t work well with certain forms of birth control/pill brands/birth control in general, which is valid, but if your body worked well with your BC and you miss it, you should go back on!\n\nETA: I want to just be real here and tell you that it’s really hard not to fall victim to right-wing propaganda like demonizing of birth control. A LOT of us have been there and second-guessed our choices. I don’t think it’s fair that misinformation and fear-mongering is allowed to just circulate out there with no real basis, especially when it relates to people’s health and their decisions about it.

My provider today agreed that it's absolutely likely the birth control caused this because of the way it changes our hormones. \n\nSince stopping almost a week ago... I haven't felt this clear headed in years, I'm starting to realize my pleasure was suppressed beyond what I even knew.\n\nSo I guess my advice is it's absolutely possible, talk to your provider, be prepared with extra protection if you're active, and good luck.

I believe that we should always remember that we are exactly the right person as we are and that we can trust ourselves and take ourselves seriously. \n\nI think that trying to give up coffee is a great start. :)\n\nI stopped taking the pill about six months ago and I'm super glad I did. I wasn't feeling particularly well before taking the pills, which is why I can now work on my issues, which is absolutely okay for me and super educational. It helped me to understand my body better and create space for my cyclical body. I also use cycle tracking myself, which I think can be an absolutely wonderful contraceptive method if implemented correctly.

The bleeding can be unpredictable and might not follow a regular pattern. \n\nInsertion: The only part that really hurts is the numbing injection. After that, you might feel a bit sore for a few days, but most people are back to normal pretty quickly.\n\nFor me, the first time I had Nexplanon, I barely had any side effects. But with my second one, I had nonstop bleeding, so I decided to get it removed. I switched to the pill, and the bleeding stopped within a few days.

I had the same fears but actually feel like myself almost all of the time now :)\n\nI tried a few pill variations including low estrogen ones, and some were ok and some I felt a little worse. I’ve been on the nuvaring for four years now and it’s been the best experience ever. It’s a constant release of hormones, and I’ve found that it works a lot better for me because there’s no “ups and downs” (hormone dump when you take the pill, then levels decrease until your next dose). I feel so stable but still have energy and the desire to do things.\n\nIn the past year or so I’ve also started taking a small dose of sertraline daily, and it’s helped a lot too. I honestly don’t know how I made it this far before I figured out what works for me, because I can’t believe how great I feel all the time now. The “trial and error” experience of birth control is super frustrating and I really empathize with how you’re feeling right now. The nice thing about the pill/ring/patch methods is that you can stop immediately if you start feeling worse. I’d suggest keeping a mood diary to keep track of any changes you feel if you start a new method. However, also keep in mind that it usually takes about three months for your body to “get used” to new hormones, so try to stick it out for that time period unless you feel really terrible.\n\nSorry this is so long but your post reminds me a lot of my situation in my early twenties!

The PMDD still sucks but at least I’m only feeling it in the luteal weeks and not my follicular phase.\n\nThe best contraception for PMDD for me was the hormonal IUD, it releases only tiny amounts of progesterone directly to the uterus so little to none is actually found in the bloodstream and it’s unlikely to impact your PMDD. I wouldn’t suggest going on the progesterone implant (nexplanon, the one in the arm) or the progesterone only pill as they release larger amounts of progesterone into the blood stream and are more likely to make PMDD worse or constant.

I recommend sipping water with a little tiny pinch of salt in it too, and that can help with some of the tension and even dizziness, which can help you feel more relaxed. \n\nIn terms of sleep, make sure to eat enough during the day and include plenty of natural fats and plenty of natural proteins. Resist the urge to increase things like caffeine intake, alcohol or junk food because that will fragment your sleep even more and make you restless. \n\nI’m really sorry you’re suffering with this. \n\nJust out of curiosity what type of drug is that?

For some, that's the all-natural route, for others that's SSRIs. Chronic stress is bad for the body, so whatever lowers your stress from the PMDD symptoms is helping you in the long term. And it's just another tool in your toolbox!\n\nI tried the all natural route too, then after a particularly dark luteal phase I decided to try wellbutrin (for reference I also have ADHD, so the mild stimulant effects have helped my ADHD symptoms as well). I take it every day and it has helped me SO MUCH. I am no longer suicidal for a full week of every month, the intrusive thoughts are manageable, and I don't have to isolate myself from my loved ones for fear of emotionally hurting them. It also took the edge off my anxiety outside my luteal phase, which has been life changing.\n\nI do still have thoughts of shame around being dependent on a medication to function, but when I look at how much happier and stable I am now, it's easy to shrug off.

There's nothing wrong with the ovaries, nothing wrong with the hormone levels; it's purely the fluctuation. We don't have any solutions for the GABA receptors, so all of our solutions focus on controlling the thing that irritates them.\n\nThe mechanism of action of SSRIs for PMDD is very fast-acting. Within 24 hours, it has been demonstrated to dial down the reaction to the fluctuations, even at a low dose. We don't know exactly how it works, but we do know it's acting on allopregnanolone, one of the primary irritants.\n\nBirth control primarily works by putting the irritants on cruise control to smooth the fluctuations. If you were only to take it part of the month, you would still get the up/down from starting and stopping it, plus you would get additional up/down as your body tries to start and stop your cycle. A combined oral contraceptive is preferred over a progestin-only because it does a better job keeping you at the same cruise control speed. The only caveat is that it needs to be a PMDD-friendly progestin. There are many progestins on the market, and only a handful jive well with our disorder.",

It doesn't suppress ovulation, so even though you're going to have a consistent dose of progesterone, your hormones will still fluctuate. \n\nI started Paxil (daily, not just luteal) while I still had my Mirena in, and it helped, but not near as much as when I got my Mirena removed and went back on a combo pill. \n\nI've been on Yasmin (drospirenone 3mg, estradiol 3mcg) and Cymbalta (60 mg) for 4 years now and its been great. \n\nHave you checked out the ebook that IAPMD put out in the last year or so? They do a really thorough analysis of birth control and SSRIs on the market (plus other treatment). Last I looked, hormonal IUDs were in the \"some evidence of success\" section, but the Nexplanon arm implant had better results than an IUD if (if youre particularly thinking of something set it and forget it) You can buy the ebook on their website.",

I don’t have journal entries, but I remember some baffling blow-ups and mood states that didn’t actually seem situationally linked. It definitely worsened things for me and caused worse mental health on top of factors already contributing to that. I was undiagnosed for a number of things, not just PMDD, but also Autism, ADHD, and now suspected PCOS (still under assessment). The PCOS makes sense for a lot, and may have even been delaying how often PMDD showed up until I finally got on a birth control around 26, as my periods tended to be skipped and didn’t show up every month before that. In general all this definitely all mashed up into a very confusing stew once actual depression and anxiety started to crop up around 5th grade for me. I can point that to being pre-period, but the intensity of it didn’t ramp up for me until post-menstruation started for me. I also have trauma from my upbringing, and was also made out to be the “melodramatic” one not to be taken seriously. Also wound up with CPTSD due to many factors. That’s a devastating life to go through, and I’m sorry you have gone through this stuff too, OP.\n\nI’m grateful to have figured PMDD out, but like you I find myself sad over it. Partly for myself going through all this, but mostly for other girls and women going through these things with no idea. My biggest thing now is to just be open with the conditions I’ve now been diagnosed with. I don’t care if it’s “cringe” or “embarrassing” to say that kind of stuff anymore, and I don’t aim to share so many exposing details I’ll trigger that reaction in someone reasonably; I just hope that by me talking about PMDD, Autism, CPTSD/PTSD, and ADHD that I can make any sort of difference for even one person.",

I think I had an actual period this week because I had the typical GI issues, intense mood swings, heavier bleeding, etc. I get alot of health anxiety around GI/bowel issues, and those issues come by more often when I'm menstruating so it's a lose-lose situation.\n\nBut where I was going with this is that my Psychiatrist did approve upping my dose of Zoloft. My CVS and MyChart say that it'll be upped to 100mg, but it kind of confuses me for the amount, so I need to message my Psychiatrist to ask if I'm reading it wrong as well as how to work my way up to the new dose.\n\nI'm sorry if this is all over the place, I'm very tired 😅 But Sertraline has worked really well for me, it just kind of seems like my cycle is immune to it (as frustrating as that is). Then again, it's a low dose vs PMDD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, heightened health anxiety, and probably a bunch of other things.\n\nI'm probably going to take my new dose all month long, I figured out through birth control that my body doesn't react to the back-and-forth fluctuations of things very well.\n\nI'm wishing you the best of luck!

Luteal isn't a breeze, but I don't think it's anywhere bad enough to be PMDD.

He should’ve taken you seriously in the first place.

Honestly a psychiatrist would be much better equipped, especially if you have other things going on like ADHD, which can have an impact on PMDD if untreated also",

That said, he has acted properly by ordering blood tests and putting you on iron pills, initially. \n\nPMDD is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that he must rule out all other potential causes of your symptoms before settling on PMDD. Blood tests, scans, mental health evaluations are all recommended. Failing to do so leads to an inaccurate PMDD diagnosis and potentially something else being missed; that could be something totally curable or something that has lifelong repercussions if missed. \n\nIron deficiency can absolutely cause mental health symptoms. If your symptoms resolve post-iron supplements...it's a good thing! \n\nIf he ignores your requests following your iron supplements, then I'd say it's time to kick up a fuss. \n\nMy only comments would be that he could have given you something for the interim (intermittent SSRI use would be inappropriate without confirming a PMDD diagnosis) and that *6 months is a very long time*. I'd check in with him at 2-3 months if you've seen no improvement in your symptoms.\n\nEdit: Regarding ADHD / ASD diagnosis, did he say *why* he couldn't do anything further? In many countries, you need to see a psychiatrist to be diagnosed and treated.\n\nIron supplements can take a few weeks/months to begin properly showing results. This is also dependent on your diet and the consistency with which you're taking them...make sure you're getting enough Vitamin C!",

My psychiatrist, therapist, and primary care doctor have all worked together to get me to the most stable frame of mind in my life. \n\nWhat has helped me the most— Wellbutrin daily, Ritalin daily, Prozac intermittently starting 10 days before my period through the start of my period, weekly therapy, lots of walking-close to 10,000 steps a day if not more, lots of contemplation on those walks, getting off all personal social media, creating instead of consuming, crafting by hand, reading. So many of my coping mechanisms are just distractions. I try to distract my way through the hard days with busy hands and a busy mind occupied by podcasts, documentaries, or call the midwife.

My PMDD symptoms started at puberty and after figuring out what it was, my emotional symptoms always lined up perfectly.\nThen I started trying to treat it in my late 30's. Progesterone (xiromed) + a copper IUD made me bleed like 3 weeks a month for a year and had me completely zombified. I quit progesterone ages ago (I think I'm almost a year out), still have the copper IUD (which could be the issue, it's crazy because I had quit having any period on the copper IUD after 6 months use, before starting the progesterone, which is apparently not usual?), and my bleeding and emotional symptoms have gotten wonky. It is making life a real struggle second guessing myself.\n\n\nIf I track my period from initial light spotting, my app will say I'm a week early. I'll stop the intermittent SSRIs I'm trying now, freak out 3-4 days into spotting, then bleed heavy as hell a couple days later on the day my app originally said I should be menstruating 😭. \n\n\nI have no idea, but I just saw a post about MCAS here the other day from a mod. My initial thought was well, I'm on hydroxyzine and still wilding so I just have PMDD.  Last night I read a little more and wondered fuck, could it be? Could it be both? I remembered having a meltdown one day years ago, leaving work (during Covid-19 so I was working from home) early, and popping 4 hydroxyzine. At that point I had only ever taken them occasionally because 1 would knock me out. I slept 30 minutes, woke up, and went straight back to work entirely fine again. I take one or two nightly now. But mother of menstruation Mary, my doctor is going to think I'm a hypochondriac when I go in wanting more crazy tests for another obscure issue. \n\n\n Sorry for the long over-share, the TLDR is: search up MCAS and see what you think! I hope you find relief soon 🖤💜🖤",

Written in such a way that it sounds like they’re trying to do good,but if you read between the lines… we are all F’ed. \n\n          *Third, I think the first thing they are trying to be established is BC being NOT COVERED by insurance. Which also means that prices could be jacked up.  (My opinion based on what I read in the pdf)\n\nThe hope would be that it could be covered if deemed “medically necessary” for purposes other than birth control, like PMDD, PCOS, Endo, Fibroids, etc. \n\nI started on BC like, 20 years ago, and having it listed as “medically necessary” was the only way it was covered back then. (Maybe?) (I had debilitating cramps, super heavy flow, etc.)\n\nI currently struggle with getting a 90 day supply, as sometimes the preferred generic changes. Or the computer says it’s not up for renewal yet, as I take it continuously with no placebo week. \nFor a “90day supply” (ie 3 months) subtract 7 days because months are 30/31 days!! And then another 3 weeks from no placebo and suddenly my 3 month supply lasts two months. I had to have my doctor write the Rx to say do not take placebo, take one a day continuously in the instructions to make it work. \nfor PMDD, with no uterus!! (Best decision I’ve ever made- giant fibroids and endo, turns out)\n\nBut the way politics are headed😵‍💫🤬, your concerns ARE VALID and we should all be wary! (I could go into explanation of why re: p2025 and things said in speeches and interviews, but that’s not for this post/comment/page. But I will recommend reading the pdf online.)",

Dr didnt know much about it, but took me seriously,  looked up info on credble medical professional website right in front of me and have been working with me ongoing to trial different meds and treatment as I try to figure it it out.   I dont think you need an expert in PMDD or even womens issues as much as you need a dr who listens to you, takes you seriously and is accessible and you trust. \n\nTreatment is very very personal for PMDD. Most have to try quite a few meds, finetune dosages, combinations, etc before finding what works for them so yes, a lot of it will be you researching and advocating for yourself ( as women need to do as a standard in the health system).  \n\nSearch previous posts on the topic. this is a very active sub so you will find a lot of experiences, information and tips.",

If a medical professional suggested you do that, you need a new one. \n\nBirth control works for PMDD by preventing ovulation. No ovulation = no symptoms. However, the hormones in birth control can also make you feel bad themselves. \n\nThey recommend you test any new birth control for *three months*, to ensure that it's working properly and your body has time to adjust. After three months, many people find that initial side effects go away. \n\nIf you have totally intolerable side effects, of course you can stop it earlier...but you should take a break before starting another pill. After throwing a load of hormones at your body and then taking them away, things can be off kilter for a month or two. \n\nI can't see why birth control would help your PMDD symptoms within a couple of days, as it's just not the mechanism of action by which they work. To my knowledge, it's estimated that it takes up to 7 days for birth control to prevent ovulation. \n\nTLDR; You've loaded your body with three different birth control pills, none of which you took frequently enough to prevent ovulation. You've likely thrown your hormones totally out of whack by doing this. I'd suggest taking a short break, before attempting again with *one* form of birth control for several weeks / months. Once you've stopped taking one, give yourself a break before moving onto the next. \n\nIf you want more information on how birth control works for PMDD, we have some great information in the wiki.\n\nEdit: Feeling hot, extreme pain, and cold hands aren't symptoms of PMDD and you should get them checked out by a medical professional.",

And you probably could find a doctor but without extreme suicidal ideation I doubt you want to take out your ovaries and go onto hrt. However it still is something you can pursue and with the right doctor make it happen. Check the child free sub for a list of doctors willing to sterilize child free young women. But know you have to have your ovaries out and go on hrt for the rest of your life if you want to combine it with a hysterectomy for progesterone intolerance if it's what you have. \n\nThis may take longer. In the meantime, you will want to immediately make an appointment with your primary care doctor to do blood work but ask for a metabolic panel with a close eye on the thyroid, to rule out, and look into starting an SSRI. As birth control is only kind of a management of symptoms type treatment that can help pmdd but an SSRI is what is called first line treatment usually",

She said if I'm having suicidal ideations or much worse mental health symptoms, to stop the birth control because it wouldn't end up working for me in the long run AND it's just not a good idea to take a med that is making you spiral.\n\n \n\nI think if you're having suicidal ideations and suddenly symptoms that you had managed before are coming back full force, you should review immediately with your psychiatrist/doctor, and if I were in your shoes, I would quit taking the pill for now (as long as I wasn't at risk of pregnancy).

I take Wellbutrin as well because after the 3 months I had some low level depression that was not at all the same depressed feeling I had with PMDD. But I was stable which was the most important element to me. I suspect I was already depressed and experiencing PME for that on top of the PMDD. The severity of the reaction doesn’t necessarily indicate its effectiveness. I would suggest taking it continuously too, if your doctor agrees. \n\nThe whole thing with PMDD is that we react to *changes* in hormones, not the hormones themselves (unless you have another disorder that does react to hormones themselves). And birth control is a big change! I mean we’re shutting off an entire system and cycle of something in your body. In a weird world where someone might have to shut off their entire digestive system without removing any organs, I would expect that to take a while and be extremely uncomfortable. \n\nI can completely understand why people give up on it as an option before the three months is over because it was awful, so they take it as a sign it’s the wrong choice. But I was at the end of my rope and realized I was miserable all the time anyway so I didn’t have a lot to lose. I could sign up for 3 months of misery with the chance of a light at the end of the tunnel, or the rest of my life in misery with no hope of being better (I’d consider the oopherectomy route eventually).

I guess it will depend on what you’re studying but building a relationship with your professors will be helpful. If they can trust you and they know you’re doing your best hopefully they will give you the flexibility that you need to get through it. Also try to not overload yourself with classes- I found 5 a semester was way too much but I could generally manage 4.\nSomething you have on your side is that you know what you’re dealing with- I had no idea what PMDD was at that time which was actually why I was forced to drop out - without a diagnosis they refused to give me accommodations.\nWishing you luck on getting the support you need to get through this- it might be challenging but not impossible!",

It makes it almost impossible to gauge each new med’s benefits, side effects, and how it interacts with all the other meds or vitamins.   So not only you wont know what it does or doesnt do, but will be hard to finetune dosing, combinations if you leave this dr. \n\nId try one thing for 2-3 cycles, see how it goes and then go from there to finetune and add things on. \n\nJust me, but I would go bc or SSRIs and then supplement ( start one at a time with vitamins). Reality is that this disease is just way too destructive and brutal. Search previous posts on this sub. So many people try ‘natural’ first and for many years, but most find that they are still struggling decades later….there is a reason that bc and/or SSRIs are top line recommended treatments. They are evidence-based and are shown to have most likely to be effective. \n\nFor insight on specific treatments, check out the wiki on this sub and also see previous posts on the topic. It is very active so you will find lots of experiences, information and advice.  \n\nBut, these wont be any indicator on whether the med will help you or you will have a bad reaction -  everyone’s biology is different, so the only way to know if it works for you and how you will go is to try it.  And yes, trying can be exhausting, emotional and scary, but hey…if you keep trying, there is at least a chance that you will get better. Otherwise you are stuck in this misery forever and forever.

Nothing too too expensive and the first three are pretty commonplace.  The flax seed is just tryptophan.  I still don't know what a collagen peptide is.  Worked like a dream.\n\nThe *fastest* thing you can try is [a low dose SSRI during luteal](https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDDpartners/wiki/index/frequentlyaskedquestions/recommendedtreatment/ldissriresources/).  Like a COC it's a [first tier treatment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDDpartners/wiki/index/frequentlyaskedquestions/recommendedtreatment/)but it's effective within hours.  If it's not, or short term side effects are intolerable, you can quit and try a different one next cycle.\n\nBut also - Don't Mirena last eight years?  Aren't you just due a new one?",

Because it's a low dose and intermittent all the scary stories you hear about SSRIs and long term side effects and withdrawal *do not apply*.\n\nAlso - if you suspect PMDD then it must be a luteal thing which means it's on a schedule and you can [plan for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDDpartners/wiki/index/bestpractices/samplesafetyplan/).  Get the boyfriend involved, it clearly affects him too.

It genuinely changed my life for the better and despite my fiancé having his own birth control, I still stay on it because it makes my periods SO much more manageable in every way. I would encourage you to give it a try, because it really doesn’t sound like the way you’re existing now is sustainable. \n\nEven if you don’t want to take the yaz, I urge you to try the lexapro.

I emotional suffered trauma from that relationship; compounded by other, previous relationships. \n\nBut that isn’t the point im trying to make. My point is that when people experience childhood trauma it can make them predisposed sometimes to getting so caught up in others and losing their identity. I experienced that with my last ex. The one I moved away with. \n\nI basically just want to say that I see you. I hear your pain. And I relate to some of what you said. Relationships can be hard.\n\nI will say that my PMS has gotten better. I haven’t been in the psych ward in over a decade.\n\nI hope healing for you soon girl. My heart goes out to you.

It’s clear from what you described that it wasn’t a good relationship and if I’ve learned anything with this illness it’s that your body will let you know when something isn’t right for you- this is the gift and the curse of PMDD.\nAll the work that you’ve done is not gone- it might take you some time to return to that place of confidence and independence because of what you’ve gone through- but I’m pretty sure all of this will make you so much wiser and stronger once you’re on the other side of it.

IUD insertion was very painful, but I haven't had complications since.\n\nBefore I was on the pill or had my IUD, I was in *crippling agony* every month. Periods lasted 8-10 days, were so heavy I was anemic for years and bled through a super tampon and a pad every hour, they were so painful I was vomiting and blacking out from cramps that left me bedbound for 3-5 days every cycle. Doctors couldn't find anything wrong with me to explain it, and it runs in my family. \n\nMy IUD has meant I haven't had a period for over a year, and when I was on the pill, I had light periods that were only mildly painful. I feel like they've given me my life back, I don't know what I would do without these options.\n\nNot to mention, birth control saved me from getting pregnant and baby trapped with my abusive husband. It gave me control over my fertility, and when I was finally ready to leave him, I wasn't legally tied to him with children. I wasn't faced with the choice to break up a family, or have children to support on my own, while I can barely support myself. It gave me the freedom to leave him.",

He is thoughtful and enjoys good (reasonable) debate.\n\nHis argument was that abortion was unfair, because men didn't get any say or have any choice. And how helpless that feels to be stripped of any choice in the matter. Instead of rolling my eyes, I listened and really considered what he was saying. I understood his argument came from personal experience (though he probably doesn't know I know), and I also have personal experience of my own.\n\nSo I told him, you're right, it's not fair. And it's not fair that women have to bear the burden of pregnancy and childbirth and all the pain and struggles and health impacts of that. It's not fair at all, biologically, and if women could *choose* to let the man handle all that, and just support him, as if the roles were reversed, so many women would do that instead of abortion. So many men want to be fathers, and maybe would happily take on the role of carrying the pregnancy if they could - but that is not a choice on the table for any of us, unfortunately.\n\nBut life and biology are not fair, and the legal system, the court of law, regulations and rules cannot change the biological unfairness of it. It's not women's fault that men cannot carry the pregnancy; and it's not mens' fault that women have to.\n\nEver since that chat, he has really changed his tune about abortion. He's much more in the \"abortion is awful, and should be avoided in every way possible, but should still be legal so people can make choices about their own body\" camp. Sometimes I think that all he really needed was for someone to acknowledge his own feelings and his own personal experience about it being unfair - and remind him that the unfairness of it is universal, and that there is no fix. \n\nThe one on one personal, empathetic, conversations we have about these topics, if we can, are really the most powerful way to handle it whenever possible.",

They are always hiring for a variety of reasons but it would be unreasonable to suggest that people should have more children so that McDonald’s always has enough workers. If we doubled the population, then we could support another McDonald’s but it would still be the same number of people in my town per McDonald’s so that doesn’t create more people willing to work at MCDonalds. Replace the word McDonalds with car repair shop, refrigerator repair service, home improvement store, etc and that concept remains true. \n\nAlready we have housing shortages, lack of teachers, lack of medical care facilities, etc. How is adding more children going to fix that? How is raising children without enough space, food, education going to create a qualified future workforce? \n\nI know there are those that don’t believe that human actions affect the climate and planet but increasing the number of children will further encroach on green spaces.

I do not regret it. \n\nMy sister was with me the whole time, i highly recommend having someone with you. We went to Marie Stopes in Ealing, they were great. \n\nWhen we got there, there was no one outside, which I had been worried about. Once checked in, I had to speak with 2 or 3 different people. Each time they checked that I knew what I was there for, and talked me through the procedure. I had to have an ultrasound to check the embryo was still there, I could choose to view it or not. I chose to look. I think they do this as the process is different if the embryo is no longer viable on its own. \n\nI then had the first pill, which terminated the pregnancy. I had to sit in the waiting room for a while for this part. \n\nThen after however long, I really can't remember, they brought me back and gave me another pill to start the explusion. Again, I had to wait in the waiting room for a while after taking the pills. \n\nOne set of the pills you put by your gums, so between your teeth and your lips, it allows for faster absorption, don't remember which it was though. May well have been both.\n\nOnce they were sure the process had started, we were allowed to leave. We took a taxi home instead of public transport. \n\nIt was horrible. I wouldn't wish it on anybody, but I also don't regret it, like I said. You will have severe cramps, and a lot of blood. I bled through my pads onto my house mates sofa, which added an extra flavour of embarrassment to the experience. I would say to buy those leak proof sheets, plastic backed, for your sofa and bed before hand. Get the most absorbant pads you can find, and lots of them. Funnily enough, post natal pads might be best, as they are really thick and meant to catch the blood after giving birth. Yes you bleed then too. \nAlso, lots of pain killers, hot water bottles, blankets and some good movies that you can loose yourself in. \n\nI have tried to be as honest as I can here, so that you can go into it knowing what to expect. If you have any questions, feel free to message me.\n\nEdited to add time frame wise, I found out when I was 4 wks, had all the appts and check ups, I had the abortion at 7 wks I think. I suffered from awful morning sickness and was really miserable throughout. My husband (then boyfriend) says it was our worst year together as I was so hormonal the entire time, first from the pregnancy, the from the combined pill as they wouldn't put me back on the could for a good 6 month or so.",

Applause for your effort and perseverance!\n\nWhile many doctors prescribe birth control blindly, they usually fail to mention the underlying cause.\n\nBased on the placement and severity of your acne, it sounds like you may have Poly-Cystic Ovarian Syndrome, which is a cluster diagnosis that includes the body producing excess androgens (male hormones)\n\nLots of birth control formulas don't affect these, only some do.\n\nTry to talk to your fictional about spironolactone. It's a targeted medication that suppresses androgens, and helps cis women dealing with stubborn acne. It also doesn't have nearly the side effects of Accutane, like suicidal thoughts.\n\nI say cis because it is taken by trans women to help transition, and you can find lots of helpful info on Trans subs about it.\n\nI really think this is an androgen issue, but the other avenue to follow for stubborn acne is fungal treatments, but I would try specifically androgen-suppressing birth control or Spiro first.\n\nThat said, the emotions are tough. We tell ourselves that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, beautiful on the inside, etc etc but as a society we know these are shallow platitudes. It's so hard and embarrassing to have to face the world when you feel so hurt and gross.\n\nI hope you are at least able to recognise your own strength and how far you have already come.\n\nEdit: including some info links\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/pcos-acne#hormones\n\nhttps://www.midlandskin.co.uk/treatments/spironolactone-acne/\n\n\nRetin-A is a prescription-strength retinoid, much stronger than any beauty counter retinol. It is proven to help with acne, and as a bonus, helps with wrinkles and scarring. It is considered the bridge between OTC meds and Accutane which should be considered a last resort.\n\nhttps://www.rexall.ca/article/drug/view/id/964\n\nDoxycycline is an antibiotic prescribed for acne, usually in combination with other treatments to help with infections / bacteria.\n\nhttps://www.verywellhealth.com/treating-acne-with-doxycycline-15837",

I think it just depends what pill you’re on, but atrociously I don’t actually know a lot about it - I take Ginet.\n\nWhen I first went on the pill as a teenager, no one ever told me I could run the packs together and not get a period for several months. I used to diligently follow the 3 weeks of pills, 1 week of placebo. (Which was crazy cause thats far more often than my period is naturally as I have PCOS) Wasn’t until my mid 20s my doctor just casually mentioned I could run them together. But also said it’s likely my body will eventually have breakthrough bleeding and I should take a break from them for a week. \n\nI find trying to force the pill while my body is trying to force a period always ends up in my body eventually just forcing the period anyway haha \n\nI can’t tell if you’ve only ever been on the pill for the last 6 months or if you’ve used it longer term before. Breakthrough bleeding it totally normal, and there shouldn’t be anything wrong :) \n\nIf you’re worried though, maybe book in with a doctor? Gyno?

Medication was not advised because it wouldn't help and you don't want her on meds. Plus they decided I was mednseeking. She couldn't have ASD either because she can make eye contact.....\n\nMy son. 1 trip to the GP, I think he has ADHD for the following reasons. I expected a fight to get him seen. No. GP agreed with me, referred him immediately. 3 weeks later we were sitting in the pysch nurses office doing an intake interview, she said he's likely ASD not ADHD, pushed us through to the doctor. 2 weeks later we walked out with a formal diagnosis of ADHD, informal ASD and a prescription for ADHD meds. \n\nThese are the same people who suggested my daughter had friends/boyfriend issues and maybe it was her period or hormones but they wouldn't medicate her. 3 appts in 5 weeks for my son and meds immediately. \n\nAnd they wonder why women are mad and push so hard for our daughters!\n\nETA: when my kids were diagnosed their doctors told me to get tested for ASD too. And after being in and out of hospital between Easter and June my doctors think maybe I have Endo. If it's not gastritis.

In short,  EVERY decision needed to be \"safe\" on a lot of levels.  \n\nOne day,  I'm in Sears.  And I FELL. IN. LOVE.  with a purse.  It was a bit expensive.  I only got myself clearance stuff and this wasn't even on sale!  It must have been...I don't know,  50 bucks in today's money.  It was a pastel rainbow in sisal.  It was a bucket style with a single snap closure.  \n\nI was always taught a bag should only be brown,  white,  black,  or navy, so it would go with almost anything.  It should have at least a flap and maybe a zipper, for security.  This bag was Forbidden.  It had a distinct style that looks great with summer wear,  but not so great with office wear.  And I could hear my mom and three sisters expressing disapproval in my head.  \n\nI wandered that store for a half hour,  trying to talk myself out of it before I realized.   It's JUST a purse!  It's a small splurge,  and it's ridiculous that I'm standing here arguing with people in my head over this Thing!  \n\nI bought the purse.  I took it home and started using it,  told my family I loved it.  Not one of them criticized me.  And within six months,  every one of my sisters,  AND my mom,  had purses that were a novel color,  or style,  or shape,  or all three.  And I didn't say anything either.  I just kept breaking the family fashion rules.  Sometimes  I didn't like the results,  but at least I now knew that!\n\nI get the existential crisis of spaghetti sauce,  and purses,  and how long your hair should be,  and everything.  Break some rules.  Try stuff.  Fail a little bit.  It's not failure; it's exploration, and you are always going to feel a bit awkward when you're outside of your comfort zone.  But it only grows when we push it.  So try some Rao and Classico and Prego, and making your own.  Throw a few things into your cart you've never tried.  And find yourself something amazing that reminds you that you are NOT bound by all the rules you've lived by.  That purse was my symbol of independence, and every day when I saw it,  I knew l could make my own choices as long as nobody was harmed by them.",

I also had shoulder surgery a week later,  because if you're going to be miserable,  you might as well be all the way miserable and get it out of the way.   I knew going in I'd need that week for my abs to recover a bit. You use shoulders and abs a lot more than you think, and having them both under renovation at the same time was rough.  \n\nA belly binder helps a bunch at first,  to ease pain.  Rest.  No, more.  MORE, damn it!  That's major surgery.  Don't try to paint the last little bit of the house,  like me, just because it's going to rain.  Make sure you have stool softeners and eat a diet to keep things loose.  The first stage of recovery is quick,  but you will be tired if you get up to much for weeks,  and if you don't pay attention to it,  you'll feel worse longer.  That said,  get up and walk a little a few times a day,  going further each time.  You DO need exercise,  but not much of it. \n\nMy libido woke up and roared about four weeks after surgery.  It was two more before I could do a think about it. I had some dryness, which we used Replens for.  That stopped after a bit.  For a while,  the libido also died back.  In my case,  I was fully surgically menopausal. I ended up going on hormone patches,  which saved my libido from joining my organs in the afterlife.  I was able to stop those after a bit, and then the picture gets fuzzy.  I may have lost and retained libido between then and now because menopause,  or because extreme stress, or the cancer that was quietly growing in my stomach and liver.  Who can say? But anyway, it's back.  \n\nMy vagina is maybe a bit shallow,  but I think it always was.  Sometimes I have to ask my husband to ease up because hitting the end of the road becomes uncomfortable over time.  But that was an issue before,  too. \n\nGood luck.

In fact, women with endometriosis often struggle to conceive. What's more, an MRI is not the only test for endometriosis. The best test is the laproscopic insertion of a camera into the area. This is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, and is part of the reason endometriosis takes, on average, 12 years to diagnose. Doctors are hesitant to order this test because it is invasive and costly.\n\nThe other thing many medical professionals won't admit to you is that they are just not knowledgeable enough about endometriosis. So, on top of doctor shopping, YOU have to be. Do as much research as possible. Document your symptoms extensively. Create a binder with all your tracked symptoms and research into diagnostic procedures and treatments and go to appointments armed with it to argue your case. \n\nIf a doctor refuses to order any disgnostic tests for you, tell them that you want it documented in your chart in front of you that they are refusing to order and tests or treatment despite your ongoing symptoms.

It's definitely important to know where yours is coming from because that can help informing treatment options. \n\nHowever, personally, I don't think your tube surgery is causing the problems unless they cut where they shouldn't have. I can see two, maybe 3 possible scenarios:\n\n1) You said the pain started right after the surgery? In that case, there is a chance they have hurt something else. Especially with so much scar tissue, it can be hard to navigate anything down there. It's not even malicious and could have gone unnoticed. \n\n2) The remainders of the tubes, aka ovaries and the other end on the uterus, are sprouting more scar tissue. It can happen after surgery that new scar tissue is forming. If it is attaching to your uterus or maybe even attaching the uterus to other organs, it can be crazy painful\n\n3) Somewhat related to 2, your endo took a big turn for the worst. There is also the possibility of fibroids forming. If there is one inside, they won't be able to see it during a sterilisation. So it would make a lot of sense to get an updated ultrasound of you can. \n\nIn any case, please check with a doctor. Your tubes technically have nothing to do with your periods. That's the uterus' job. So whatever is going on there is related to it. I bet it on scar tissue attaching to it, as that's what has been Crippling me over the years. I am NOT a doctor, of course!",

You’ve thought about names, you’ve imagined being a mom, and you’ve said you don’t know if you could live with the guilt of an abortion. That tells me that part of you does want to keep the baby, even if the practical and relationship side feels impossible.\n\nAt the same time, your fiancé has been very clear that he doesn’t want children, and the two of you have built a life around that. Raising a child without both partners being fully on board is incredibly hard, and it would mean facing a lot of challenges on your own. That’s important to weigh up, too.\n\nI don’t think there is a right or wrong choice here. What matters is which one you can live with in the long term, not just in this moment. It might help to set aside what your fiancé wants for a moment and really ask yourself what you can carry in your heart five or ten years from now.\n\nWhatever you decide, it should be the decision that brings you the most peace with yourself.",

It literally would not go in. I was convinced that a rape would have literally destroyed me internally.\n\nEventually it became a genuine concern that there was an anatomical issue (like a vaginal septum). I had an exam under anesthesia, during which an apparently very thick and vascular hymen with a relatively small opening, was discovered and removed. (Note: whether or not this exam happened was 100% up to me.) I woke up sore with a pad that developed a half-dollar sized area of blood. I'm eternally grateful that it wasn't during sex. Honestly I don't know how it would have happened consensually without some sort of other intervention, at the very least lidocaine. \n\nSome time in the next few months I was able to use a tampon. I had to be on my back with lube, so it was a bit longer before I could actually insert them out of the house. YMMV, I've only ever used OB tampons because they're small and my finger was more forgiving than an applicator. \n\nIt was a long road, but 15 years later (for unrelated reasons I just wasn't attempting sex for the vast majority of that time) I was able to have discomfort free sex.

Sometimes, she'll purposely poke at my vulnerabilities to get attention. It's endlessly frustrating. \n\nThe worst part is realizing she's not the woman I idolized as a child. She's human, she's flawed, and she's woefully unprepared to address her own emotional disregulation. Part of it is her own childhood trauma, part is lack of a social network, and then add in some stubbornness. It doesn't make it okay, but sometimes it helps to understand why a person acts a certain way. \n\nMost importantly, I've realized that I'm not going to change her.

And she was extremely emotional, but didn't recognise that. She would believe she was acting and reacting rationally, because she wasn't actively shouting or rowing, but her words and actions were driven purely by her emotional response to things.\n\nMy own issues (undiagnosed ASD and cPTSD both from early childhood emotional trauma and the constant minor trauma of being autistic in a world that doesn't know and doesn't care) didn't help our relationship at all, and in no way is she 100% to blame for us basically having no emotional relationship for 20-30 years, but if she'd had even the slightest ability to sit with feeling bad, to look objectively at her own flaws and take responsibility for them, to not perceive simply not sharing the same opinion about something as literally actively negatively judging her, we possibly could have actually worked on it and gotten to properly know one another.\n\nAs it is, while I'll never truly know if I knew her or not, I absolutely know she did not know me in the slightest, despite insisting - even to my husband - that she knew me better than anyone, better than him, maybe even better than myself.\n\nShe had her opinion formed when I was a young child, and then when I started to become an independently-thinking adolescent didn't know how to cope with that (I had been a very compliant child who turned to mammy for everything), formed a different image of teenage/adolescent me - which wasn't even accurate, but how and ever - and then never changed that one ever again. And so everything out of my mouth was already pre-perceived, pre-filtered, through whatever veil she saw me through.\n\nI'm deeply sorry you're going through something that seems so similar, and I wish I had advice or suggestions, but I'm afraid I don't.\n\nMy mam died of Alzheimer's in 2018, but we hadn't been close - or at least she hadn't really known me and I'd given up trying to have an adult relationship with her - for years before then.

I came off in January after nearly 8 years on the pill (Yasmin) and my first luteal phase was pretty brutal, my mental health plummeted and I felt so low (and I’m generally not someone who struggles with their mental health!). At the time I didn’t realise that this was linked to my luteal phase, it was only with hindsight when I was feeling more like myself again that I put two and two together. I remember thinking that if every luteal phase is like this, I’m going back on the pill. Thankfully each luteal phase since then has been much easier - I still get a bit teary/irritable/lethargic around that time of the month, but that’s very common. I also struggle a bit with insomnia during my late luteal phase and the first couple of days of my period but again, this is pretty common - the rest of my cycle I generally sleep fine.\n\nMy skin isn’t as clear as it was on the pill but I’d describe it more as texture/congestion than full blown spots/acne, especially on my forehead - it’s just something I’ve learned to put up with and manage with skincare, although I’m still hoping it’ll improve with more time. My hair started shedding around 2 months after I came off the pill and that has probably been the hardest part for me. I was just thinking yesterday that thankfully the shedding seems to have slowed down a lot the last couple of weeks, but it lasted a good 6 months.\n\nMy cycles still aren’t what you’d call regular, although they never were before I went on the pill. I haven’t been ovulating until around day 28 most cycles - however I’ve had bloods done and the doctor said that everything looks normal, so this seems to be normal for me. I’d recommend tracking your cycles using BBT/ovulation tests/symptom tracking to get an idea of what’s normal for you.\n\nHang in there, it will get easier. Once you get to the 6 month mark, you should be feeling much more normal, if not before then. In the meantime, try to prioritise going to sleep early (although I appreciate this is difficult with insomnia), eating well and exercising regularly. And look into supplements that can support your body post-pill, as the pill is known to deplete certain nutrient levels.\n\nEdit: I’m 25, almost 26 for reference.",

It really, really needs to be the best call for your situation and usually any other option is better for your health. \n\nIf you haven’t had a period since you were 15, they will mostly likely recommend and you should try going off BC for a few months and see - your periods as an adult can be wildly different from a teenager. If they are still awful, what you probably want is a uterine ablation. This destroys the lining of the uterus to prevent heavy bleeding. This is a permanent procedure but much less invasive with less complications than a hysterectomy. \n\nYou cannot safely get pregnant after an ablation, so if you end up in a relationship where you are exposed to sperm you’ll need BC as it’s not a form of sterilization. That is something you can pursue alongside an ablation, doctors should happy to do a salpingectomy to prevent the risk of pregnancy after an ablation.",

They think others are treated favorably because any loss of advantage feels like unfairness. Men needed others to keep being oppressed so that their path was easier than everyone else's.\n\nA good way of explaining this to men is to talk about sports. In the past, only white men competed in sports as black men were excluded in mainstream sports. After awhile, superstar black men were allowed in, but not better than average players. Only later did they allow an equal playing field where capability mattered more than skin color and superior black players tended to dominate some sports. White men dominated as long as better men were held back and excluded.\n\nNow that women are allowed into all domains of life, superior people are competing with average white men. They think the only reason people unlike them are edging them out is favoritism. They can't comprehend that the deck has been stacked in their favor and their angry about it. The right has great appeal to them because it is promising to put women back in their place.\n\nWe don't have to solve this mess. We just have to refuse to accept the status quo that conservatives will attempt to impose upon us. The best way to do that is to be independent, successful, and to form community and comraderie with other women to pull them up and support them. Men need women more than women need men. That is clear from all of the posts about men who cannot cope emotionally, physically, or logistically with daily life without women taking on the burden. It is clear from the fact that married men are happier and live longer than single men.\n\nBe your best self and mentor and support other women. Get a good education and a good job.

For me it wasn’t really cervical pain any more than a PAP smear as much as the uterine cramping while it adjusted to its new inhabitant. If you’re worried about pain you can question your gyno about a cervical block and make sure to take Tylenol before and for a day (or a few) afterwards.

I got mine out a few years back and it was the best thing I ever did for myself.\n\n\nClarification though- are you sure you're getting ligation, not salpingectomy? Ligation clips or cauterizes the tubes and has a 1/50 failure rate, usually ectopic. Bilateral tubal salpingectomy removes the tubes completely, has a 0% failure rate, and reduces ovarian cancer risk by at least 30%. It is the current standard of care for female sterilization because of this. \n\n\nIn the US under the affordable care act, insurance must cover bisalp at 100%. There's a language loophole that means they aren't mandated to *advertise* coverage for bisalp, but they legally MUST cover it. They might resist because insurance, but if you show them you know your rights by attaching the excerpt from the ACA, it's very hard to argue. I strongly encourage you to reach out to your surgeon and insurance! My surgeon wrote a strongly worded letter to my insurance after an initial denial for bisalp (they said they'd only cover ligation), and after that they approved it. I didn't pay a dime other than copays for doctor visits before and after. It's absolutely worth following up on!",

I think they're 52mg, and opposed to Kyleena which is less. You might want to consider getting your Kyleena replaced with the slightly higher hormone level IUD so you can more likely get the benefits of no bleeding at all. I've personally benefitted a lot from being period free.\n\nI'd definitely get it checked out by a doctor if you're bleeding that much. You're pretty young still, only 21, and you're right that using condoms only will increase your risk of pregnancy a lot. If you're having a lot of sex, definitely don't go birth control free if you can avoid it. I know other people can feel strongly about hormonal birth control, but any kind of temperature test you might do for yourself just increases your chances of error and pregnancy so much, it's probably not worth the risk. \n\nGood luck!",

I don't really have any side effects as far as I can tell, and it stops my periods completely which is what I want. Nexplanon on the other hand made me bleed for like 8 straight months and made me incredibly depressed. The POPs also made me extremely depressed. All three of those things are progesterone only, and for some reason Mirena is great while the others make me suicidal. I think POPs are worth a try for you, they effect everyone differently and just because other hormonal methods don't work for you doesn't mean it's hopeless at all.

I didn't have to fight any harder than saying \"I have heavy and painful periods and I do not want children. Please give me an endometrial ablation.\"\n\nNo IUDs. No transexamic acid. No \"We'll check up on you in another 6 months to see if [x] has worked.] I was on the table 3 months later.\n\nThey used general anaesthesia rather than twilight sedation, but I too was in and home the same day. I think I had to be there c. 6 a.m. and got shipped home c. 4 p.m.\n\nI had cramps for 2 weeks after the procedure that weren't even 1/4 as bad as my usual menstrual cramps and were easily controlled with a regular dose of ibuprofen. Haven't menstruated since. It cut my cramps by 90% and my PMDD by 60%. \n\nThat was just about the only non-traumatic experience I ever had with the NHS, but **I want women to know that it _can_ be this easy.** Getting this shit treated in a timely fashion is _entirely possible_.

I joked that I'd definitely give him a heads up *before* kicking him in the teeth.

Antifungal cream for us both cleared it up once and forever. I don’t recall my partner having symptoms himself but I got a very localized rash after any kind of skin contact. \n\nLook at photos of facial yeast infections. Your pics are a good match. \n\nThrush is a yeast infection—candidiasis. Typically it doesn’t present on the skin which is presumably why it’s often overlooked in favor of more common rashes. You may have physical signs on your skin which are covered up by your beard. Or have little presentation at all. You can still spread it. \n\nLuckily it is very common and easy to treat! It sounds like there may be an antifungal medication you can take successfully instead of a cream— a commenter below said they had success with Diflucan.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23201-yeast-infection-on-face",

Progesterone goes from high to low during that time, but I am not entirely sure of it‘s effects on skin health. And T usually causes more sebum to be produced, thicker skin and so on. E does the same, but way less and usually inhibits it a bit, due to the estrogen receptors inhibiting some activity of the androgen receptor. \n\nSo I would guess that the increase in sebum productions clogs pores and thereby causes acne. You can try fitting your skincare to your cycle:\n\nAt the start more gentle products are probably right (all sex hormones are low, so your skin is probably more sensitive and dry). Throughout your follicular phase your hormones rise, but I would keep it with gentle stuff. And the sudden high peak during ovulation might not be long enough to cause significant changes in that (but everybody is different, so it could also do smth.). But during the luteinizing phase your progesterone rises, which causes the increased sebum production. But it also gets metabolized into testosterone, which increases it even more. The days before menstruation prog. falls again, but testosterone is still high and your sebum production is likely at maximum in that time. So you could try using more stronger products in the last 7 days of your cycle (can also be shorter or longer, most people with a cycle dont have the standard 28 days, that everybody got tought were normal).\n\nBasically (assuming it is 28 days) you would be using gentle products the first 21 days and more stronger products the last 7 days. But try around and fit this to your needs and your cycle. \n\nBy fitting your routine to your cycle, you dont necessarily need to take the pill. But you can of course also try that",

Depending on where you live, do discuss azelaic acid with a dermatologist, and:\n\n- Water wash in the morning only,\n\n- Use Spf to avoid and limit further sun damage and marks; LRP Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid should be great for your skin, and you can get a tinted version if you’re into that.\n\n- Any oil-free moisturizer should be great to restore your skin barrier. The Weleda I believe isn’t oil-free. Maybe move the Effaclar to day time before the sunscreen, and for night time azelaic acid followed by LRP Hydraphase Light or any lightweight oil free moisturizer (confirm to me whether Weleda is oil-free because iirc it isn’t).\n\n\nConsistency is key, and I’m betting some good money on azelaic acid for your face ❤️",

Do not go for a walk outside during lunch. Wear a big sun hat as you enter and exit the building. \n\nOnce your barrier recovers you need to make sure this doesn’t happen again. Are you making sure your skin is completely dry before applying tret? Applying it to damp skin increases absorption and hence potential irritation. Also make sure you are waiting after applying tret before applying moisturizer, for the same reason.

I'm sorry to hear the second round didn't have long term effects for you :' makes me worried about the way mine will go long term. \n\nJust wondering, but are you possibly taking any supplements that include Vitamin B? This especially applies to Vit B6 and B12. I ask because I notice my current acne looks pretty similar to yours, and it definitely gets worse when I regularly take Vit B supplements. There are also studies that have shown it can correlate with increased oil/sebum production in a way that can increase acne. I unfortunately have to take B12 supplements due to a deficiency, but that can be something you might be able to cut down on.\n\nOtherwise, I will say- if you feel the Arazlo lotion isn't helping, it's very ok to stop taking it. It's possible you might be sensitive to an ingredient in it, since it seems you feel your acne has gotten worse since starting it. \n\nSimilarly, if you've been using your current moiturizer(the Barrier Care Gel Cream) for a while and you feel your skin isn't doing great while you're using it, it could be worth trying out a different moisturizer. I checked out the ingredients in it, and it seems to be a really long list that could make it hard to figure out which individual ingredient you're sensitive to.\n\nI've had a lot of trouble finding moisturizer that works in the past, but one that consistently works for me is straight up Aveeno Daily Lotion (the generic kind they advertise for body, not just for face). It's a really minimal formulation, but I find it really calms my acne in comparison to other ones I've tried. It also works well under sunscreen as long as it's dried down enough.",

Niacinamide will help you in the AM after cleansing. The Ordinary have both of these products as cheap starting points if you want to trial before spending more (I preferred their old Niacinamide formula, but other brands do them too). Paula's choice have a BHA Salicylic Acid toner, as do Farmacy, but they both cost more. However toners are very easy to layer, as sometimes multiple serums can pill.\n\nYou should be cleansing twice a day, but possibly not with the same cleanser, try something gentle in the AM and then something a little more in the PM. \n\nThen find an SPF for oily skin. \n\nI have combination skin but my T-zone was very oily. \n\nHow are your pores? Salicylic acid is extra important in your routine if you have larger pores and/or are getting breakouts from the oil.\n\nETA: Remember it takes a while to see benefits/skin to adjust so choose a new routine and stick to it for at least 3 months. They say to add one new thing to your routine at a time so you can tell which products are working, but you need an overhaul so I say plough ahead :p",

The test results published by the brand to get their label claim and listing turns out to be from a lab riddled in historical fraud (industry insiders are saying there are several labs out there that are doing this type of fraud).\n\nIt's also been found that this 22.75% zinc oxide formula is a contract manufacturer formula that other brands are using. \n\nIt's known that Naked Sundays is using this manufacturer. It's also turns out this manufacturer has had violations with regulators. The zinc oxide supplier also had violations with regulators too.\n\n[https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/wild-child-wa-pty-ltd-589463-12062019](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/wild-child-wa-pty-ltd-589463-12062019)\n\n[https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/antaria-pty-ltd-674495-03222024](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/antaria-pty-ltd-674495-03222024)\n\nYou can see more of Australians' take on this here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AusSkincare/comments/1lfxi1q/choice\\_sunscreen\\_testing\\_megathread/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusSkincare/comments/1lfxi1q/choice_sunscreen_testing_megathread/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AusSkincare/comments/1m02nym/would\\_you\\_feel\\_comfortable\\_relying\\_on\\_naked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusSkincare/comments/1m02nym/would_you_feel_comfortable_relying_on_naked/)\n\nAlso fan favorite Michelle at Labmuffin weighed in several times (after being misinterpreted by her own fans) and says people shouldn't be using these 22.75% zinc oxide formulas for the time now:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AusSkincare/comments/1m148fb/zinc\\_based\\_sunscreen\\_recommendations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusSkincare/comments/1m148fb/zinc_based_sunscreen_recommendations/)\n\nLiterally to quote Michelle:\n\n\"Zinc technology hasn't improved that much - it still seems to be pretty unreliable for giving consistently high protection without compromising on skin feel. It's likely that a lot of the nicer feeling zinc oxide sunscreens out there have lower SPFs than on the label.\n\n\n\nFor example Ultra Violette's SPF 50+ Lean Screen sunscreen was recently retested to be SPF 4-5 by Choice, it seems like they used a dodgy SPF testing lab. Their manufacturer makes a lot of other \"surprisingly light\" zinc sunscreens from different brands, including the vast majority of the ones people have mentioned in the replies here, and they're very likely also tested by the same testing lab.\n\n\n\nWhatever the root cause of the Lean Screen issue is (there's a few possibilities), it's likely that a lot of other \"surprisingly light\" zinc oxide sunscreens out there also have lower SPFs than expected (though I don't think they're all as low as SPF 4 to 5).\"\n\nDo what you will with this information. But just wanted to share it with you in case it will concern you because it's a really big concern in the country where the brand originates.",

The stress is normal, but they won’t stay gone forever, so dont worry ok. Here are budget friendly options, i suggest: \n\n**Castor oil (cold-pressed), Coconut oil or Vitamin E oil, and Biotin supplements.**\n\n**Castor oil:** Its cheap, safe, and often used for lash health. Make sure to apply lightly with a clean cotton swab. And btw Everyone's skin is unique, so what works for one person may cause a reaction in another.\n\n**Coconut oil or Vitamin E oil:** Also inexpensive, available at most stores and hydrating.\n\n**Biotin supplements:** Costco/Walmart sell affordable ones, it actually supports hair growth in general btw.\n\nYou should also do safe practices, as in avoid rubbing or pulling at the lash line, keep the eye area clean and free from heavy makeup, and please if irritation happens as in redness, swelling, or pain, stop products and consider seeing a doctor.\n\nAnd of course the $200 serums are not an option, i recommend EssyNaturals, GrandeLASH minis, or even Costco's Kirkland biotin gummies, theyre affordable, often under $30. Plus some prescriptions serums (like latisse) can cause discoloration.\n\nSo please do not stress too much, lashes usually grow back within a month or two. If you're avoiding pricey serums, you could try the options i recommended above. Just be gentle with your lash line and avoid rubbing it. You'll be okay and hopefully theyll be back before your events.\n\nBut please remember nothing is ever 100% guaranteed safe for everyone. Even 'natural\"' oilse like castor or coconut oil can cause irritation in some people, especially near the eyes, which are very sensitive. Same for supplements like biotin, they're generally safe, but some people may get mild side effects (skin breakouts, stomach upsets).\n\nAs i said before, these are what i recommend, i will for your sake, re-explain:\n\n**Castor oil/Vitamin E/Coconut oil:** They are wildly used, cheap, and safe for *most* people, but always make sure to patch test on skin first and use only a tiny amount on laches (please please please avoid getting it in the eye, since as i said, they're very sensitve).\n\n**Biotin supplements:** Common at Costco or Walmart, generally safe if you stick to the normal daily dose like 1,000 - 5,000 mcg. But if someone already eats a balanced diet, it may not speed things up dramatically, just saying.\n\n**Affordable serums (EssNaturals, GrandeLASH mini, etc.):** Safe for most users, BUT some report irritation or redness. The concern about discoloration or fat loss applies mostly to prescription latisse (bimatoprost), not these milder ones.\n\nSO, the lashes will naturally regrow on their own in 6 to 8 weeks anyway. Oils/supplements just *support* the process, they dont magically fast forward it... (I wish it could ngl).\n\nBut anyway best advice: If there's pain, swelling, or signs of infection, please please go see a doctor. Otherwise gentle care and patience works.",

It is FDA approved for the treatment of high blood pressure.  It can also be used off label (which means other than it's FDA approved indication) as a treatment for hormonally influenced acne in women.\n\nWhat your doctor may have been trying to say is that certain birth control medications contain drospirenone (like Yaz) which is  a form of spironolactone (hence the \\*spir\\* in the medication name).  So if you were taking Yaz or generic dropsirenone you wouldn't want to also take spironolactone, since it's more spironolactone than you would need.  TL, DR; there are forms of spironolactone in certain birth control medications.\n\nThat said, there doesn't have to be anything wrong with your hormones from you to benefit from spironolactone.  Also you could take certain types of birth control (like drospirenone) which essentially work the same as spironolactone, so that's something to keep in mind in case you want to re-open communication with your physician.

It seems to be a very new product as I was only able to find it on Olive Young. It is in the same line as their other Madecassoside products like the blemish repair serum and their sheet mask (both of which I also use). It is an *extremely* lightweight sun serum, probably the most lightweight one I have ever tried that doesn't contain drying alcohols, like some of the J-beauty ones, and actually has some soothing barrier supportive benefits.

Then start using the Epiduo all over your face every other day once your skin doesn’t feel as irritated. \n\nI’m not sure where you’re located, or what you’re financial situation is, but if you’re in the market for some new products, I recommend the Krave Beauty Matcha Cleanser (safe to order on Amazon), Avene thermal water spray, Experiment Beauty’s Super Saturated serum and their Molecular Mesh moisturizer. All of these are super hydrating and support barrier repair. If you’re still struggling with the Epiduo after a while, I would switch over to regular adapalene gel or maybe even azelaic acid. \n\nYou know your skin better than anyone so trust yourself!

I’m just curious if it may help you if you also have eczema. It’s my understanding that Xolair is supposed to be safe to take while pregnant but obviously that’s between you and your doc. I also did not find any relief from the topical steroid and did not feel comfortable slathering it on day after day. Sarna anti itch lotion after a cool shower has been my saving grace. Has your allergist run labs for your IgE, tested for celiac and Lyme just to rule things out?\n\nRe the acne, you’re already taking the less is more approach which is the advice we hear most often. I would maybe look into some facial treatments. They won’t provide a permanent solution but I feel like it’s worth the pampering to help ease some of the mental strain flare ups cause me.

Tried to stop again, same thing just painful and awful. But about ten months ago I stopped again because the pill gives me bad depression and I just can't take it anymore and I have had literally the lightest acne, just one or two small ones before my period and using Tretinion just takes care of it so easily (I tried using Tretinion the last two times and it was not helpful and made it much more sensitive).\n\nI think it comes down to hormones and for me I was in my late twenties when I tried quitting before, and now I am approaching my mid thirties and I have to guess that things have just calmed down hormonally in general and that's why it's been so much better this time. I never had acne before the pill, I was just using it for birth control. I literally feel so much off the pill and I'm so happy I tried again and was successful. All this is to say that I did it all the last couple times, supplements, products prescriptions and nothing helped and suddenly now it's just not an issue anymore. I couldn't fight my hormones and I just feel like I'm lucky it finally let up. I had almost convinced myself I'd be on the pill forever. Not sure how old you are but depending on your age perhaps it's just a waiting game for you as well. I hear your hormones freak out around the 30 years mark and I guess for me that was definitely true.",

They can be really helpful too since they add hydration, while a moisturizer is usually more moisture and occlusivity. Some also come in a spray bottle so they go on even easier.\nThe one I've used for several years has been discontinued, but some popular hydrating toners I've seen good reviews for include (from thinner texture to thicker): Cosrx propolis toner, Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Toner, Dr. Cearacle Kombucha Essence, and Haruharu Probiotic Barrier Essence.\nYour skin should get used to the differin, but it's always always a little bit drying I find so it's important to keep up with a really hydrating and gentle routine.\nMy dry skin does really really love slugging. Vaseline and aquaphor are ok but Cerave Healing Ointment is absolutely magic IMO. It's a little less greasy and just makes my skin suuuper soft. Just caution though, as they usually reccomend only slugging on nights you are not using a retinol, since it will trap that in your skin as well as the moisturizer and can increase irritation. I've been using differin for several years now and have built up to using it almost every night so I slug with it no problem now, but I wouldn't start with that.",

But petroleum jelly can make active ingredients from your other products penetrate more deeply and cause more irritation)\n\n* fractionated coconut oil aka caprylic/capric triglyceride (I’m using aura cacia brand) - I was really skeptical to try this on my face since regular coconut oil is one of my biggest acne triggers in skincare, but apparently the fatty acids that tend to clog pores are all removed and this is actually pretty well tolerated and noncomedogenic for most people (is actually the second ingredient in the Pyunkang yul lotion). I use it more as a body moisturizer but it doesn’t seem to break me out when I use it on my face \n\nI also haven’t repurchased it recently but when nothing else was working for me I’ve used Aveeno moisturizing lotion on my face and it was actually pretty decent? ",

I started double cleansing and they are 95% gone.\nFor reference, I live in a super dry climate and have Hashimotos which makes my skin extra super duper prone to being dry.\nI double cleanse with a cleansing balm in the shower or a cleansing oil at my sink and wash with a BHA cleanser to get the oil off. \nEven using tretinoin from the semi shady Indian pharmacy constantly did nothing for them\n\nThe only area I still get comedones is on my chin and I have started using 10% glycolic acid on it (from willow wholesale on Amazon) and those are rapidly disappearing. They only come up on days like today where I slept in my makeup and didn’t wash my face until 4 pm. Occasionally I’ll get some tiny almost black head like dots on my cheeks but I never get surprise dots that are secretly huge pus filled blackheads anymore. And I don’t get them along my jaw line.\n\nHere’s my routine - \nCleansing balm - COSRX full fit cica smoothing balm \nOr -\nPapa recipe blemish cleansing oil \n\nHaruharu wonder black rice triple cleansing gentle AHA gel\nBare minerals salicylic acid gel cleanser \n\nNaturium vitamin c all over \n.05% tretinoin gel on my lines and any active spots \nWillow wholesale 10% glycolic acid all over areas I get comedones (one layer, do NOT overdo this as it will burn your skin off in 3+ layers. I also use this on my KP and it works gloriously!)\n5% salicylic acid from Pure Original Ingredients store \n\nIunik beta glucan moisturizer - my absolute holy grail for 5 years \nHyaluronic acid mixed with water in a spray bottle misted on my face \n\nAnd I remember to clean my pillowcase or switch it out… sometimes. Maybe once every 4-6 weeks. \n\nI also shower at night and never go to bed if I feel like I have exerted myself quite a bit that day. Showering at night helps ensure that my bed stays clean longer and my skin isn’t just marinating in its own juices. And I sleep on my back usually, sometimes turned on my right side (which is where I get comedones 90% of the time).\n\nAlso, probiotics, but not shitty ones. Three-lac is the best one I have ever found and will absolutely make you fart like a dairy cow the first few days. But your skin will be gorgeous after. \n\nI got all the Asian products from olive young",

A common culprit is silicone in one product, but the other being more oil based. I know it sounds complicated, and it is. I try out tons of products and I will use sunscreens that perform perfectly under my makeup for a week, then one day I'll switch to a different foundation and suddenly it's pill city. \n\nBut I will say the spf I've found that seems to work best under foundation for me is the new Tatcha.

There are ingredients in sunscreen and makeup that react to one another in the same way that some primers are better formulated for oil based vs water based vs silicone based foundations. I've also noticed different results when using liquid/cream vs powder foundation.\n\nIf anyone can share their tried and true 'equation' id love to get the science down but I intend to start pairing like-with-like in the future.\n\nIn general clear, alcohol based sunscreens work for me as much as I dislike the aerosols for countless reasons. \n\nAsian Sunscreens also tend to sit best for me. Jm Solution marine spray is my favorite, it is greasy but doesnt burn my eyes and havent noticed much oxidization of liquid or powder make up. After liquid and a setting powder I have a healthy glow/sheen.  For a stick sunscreen, Innisfree sunscreen stick has worked surprisingly well on vacation where i doubted the jm solutions would get through security, my makeup tends to be more matte immediately after application which is great because I get pretty sweaty as day wears on. Biore watery essence (cream) is another favorite. I also brought he skin1001(?) Centella cream on vacation and it was pretty solid with a korean cc cream - miisha brand, but with powder foundation was a total fail. \n\nI've lost hope with American sunscreen but Sun bum's spray sunscreen is a readily available and I believe it did pretty well under make up! The pricepoint and random eye burning (I'm particularly sensitive) has made most american sunscreens irrelevant for me.",
